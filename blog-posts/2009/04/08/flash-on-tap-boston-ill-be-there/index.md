# [Flash On Tap, Boston… I’ll Be There](http://custardbelly.com/blog/2009/04/08/flash-on-tap-boston-ill-be-there/)

![todd anderson](http://www.custardbelly.com/blog/images/me_sad.jpg) … not that you’d actually be going to see this handsome fellow. That’s the look i give when they run out of Stone Ruination IPA.

Aah. When springtime in Boston hits, the weather is still cold for a couple months and the beer is flowing again. Actually, the beer flows all the time and the weather is unpredictable. Nonetheless, you know you are in for a good time, and i am looking forward to the [Flash On Tap](http://flashontap.com/fot/index.html) debut in my home town.

The beer sponsor list is amazing. Most beers you won’t be able to find on tap in our fair city, let alone the lot of them all in one place – aside from *possibly* my [neighborhood](http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/2247/?view=beerfly) haunts in [Brookline](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=brookline+ma&oe=utf-8&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-a&um=1&ie=UTF-8&split=0&gl=us&ei=Vj_dSZPfHePulQfx46D0DQ&sa=X&oi=geocode_result&ct=title&resnum=1) (hit em up when you are out here). Stone, Smuttynose, Haverhill, Boulder.. the list goes on. In that order for me at least. I am excited about Haverhill, because even though it is a local brew (you gotta try, their LeatherLips it is awesome) some i have not tried because they are just not out here in my brick-filled neck of the woods. 

Oh yeah… And then there’s gonna be some people rambling on about what-nots and crap. If you ain’t pourin’, i’m snorin’. That’s what i say. In all seriousness, [the line up is insane](http://flashontap.com/fot/index.html#/speakers/). The beer is just icing on a knowledge cake waiting to cook.

See my sad face and full belly as i drink all the Ruination.
