_**as3flobile** is a set of ActionScript 3 components targeting the Flash Player on Mobile Devices, whether it be embedded in the browser or in an Adobe AIR application. You find out more about the project at [http://github.com/bustardcelly/as3flobile](http://github.com/bustardcelly/as3flobile)._

What with the latest [breaking news on rollback of restrictions for iOS application submissions](http://business-news.thestreet.com/link/?http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2010/09/09statement.html;;;http://business-news.thestreet.com/business/2010/09/09/a/692864524-statement-by-apple-on-app/;;;http://business-news.thestreet.com/business/2010/09/09/a/692864524-statement-by-apple-on-app/), i decided to set some time to drop the **as3flobile** components into an AIR app and publish with the **pfi**. They work great and actually are quite a bit more responsive (go figure!) in regards to both animation and touch response (due to hardware i suppose).

The **as3flobile** project actually started out as a way to play around with **Flash** on the **iPhone**, but shifted to a suite a components targeting mobile devices that supported the **Flash Player** in browser (i forget why the focused changed ![;)](http://custardbelly.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif) ). In any event, i just wanted to write a quick post that, yes, you can use **as3flobile** components in an AIR application on Android and now iOS… (well, i guess it was always possible, just never a strong possibility that anyone would be able to see it unless you added them to your provision ![:)](http://custardbelly.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif) ).

If you are interested, the [**as3flobile** project is available on github](http://github.com/bustardcelly/as3flobile), so check it out.
