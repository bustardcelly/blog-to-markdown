I have previously written about __TDD__ in JavaScript, most notably using the BDD-style library [Jasmine](https://github.com/pivotal/jasmine) in a series on [building a Test-Driven Grocery List Application](http://custardbelly.com/blog/blog-pages/category/grocery-ls.html). In that posts series I went through thinking of User Stories for features and scenarios as actual development tasks, and - reading back on it - it's all very green in my finding a way to deliver test-driven code. Nothing wrong with that and I will most likely look upon this and subsequent posts in the same manner. That said, I still hold true that TDD is the best way to deliver concise, tested and well thought-out code.

Since that time, however, I have incorporated a different tool into my __TDD__ workflow for JavaScript-based projects that affords me the integration of feature specs more closely to my development and truly encompasses my current ideal of __Behaviour Driven Development__: [CucumberJS](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js).

## Gherkin

## Step Definitions

## World

## Grunt Tasks

## Conclusion
In a following post I want to address how I use cucumberjs to run tests that rely on browser integration - ie, window and document access.

In the past I have used zombie to much success, but oscar has tipped me to him karma solution that I am excited to test-drive.
