	<div class="entry-content full-content">
		<p>I just put up some files on <a href="http://github.com/bustardcelly/" target="_blank">github</a> under the project name <a href="http://github.com/bustardcelly/flex-runtime-css" target="_blank"><strong>flex-runtime-css</strong></a>. Perhaps it is a misnomer if people are coming to see how to load and parse CSS files (there’s already the <a href="http://github.com/theflashbum/fcss" target="_blank">great <strong>F*CSS</strong> library</a> out there for that). The <strong>flex-runtime-css</strong> project is intended to address a problem i saw when generating a <strong>Runtime CSS SWF</strong> to be loaded in a <strong>Flex Application</strong>.</p>
<p>Sometimes a project calls for loading in CSS at runtime rather than compiling the style sheets in. Often enough this is due to a project requirement to have dynamic styling/skinning based on separate client vendors, <em>yadda-yadda</em>. To generate these <strong>Runtime CSS SWF</strong> files i use the <strong>Adobe MXMLC</strong> compiler tool from the <strong>Flex SDK</strong>. If you are unfamiliar about how to generate a <strong>CSS SWF</strong> or how to load in the <strong>SWF</strong> at runtime for style declarations, you can visit the the <strong>Adobe live docs</strong> on the subject at <a href="http://livedocs.adobe.com/flex/3/html/help.html?content=styles_10.html" target="_blank">http://livedocs.adobe.com/flex/3/html/help.html?content=styles_10.html</a>.</p>
<p>The problem i was running is that the default <strong>flex-config</strong> used by the <strong>MXMLC</strong> tool in <strong>Flex 4</strong> now links against several <strong>RSL</strong>s. I won’t go into a discussion of <strong>RSL</strong>s, but the reason for this is lower application size. That’s great for an application, but unnecessary when generating a <strong>CSS SWF</strong>. In fact, if you generated a <strong>CSS SWF</strong> using the default <strong>flex-config</strong> via the following command:</p>

<div class="wp_syntax"><div class="code"><pre class="actionscript" style="font-family:monospace;"><span style="color: #66cc66;">&gt;</span> mxmlc MyStyle.<span style="color: #006600;">css</span></pre></div></div>

<p>… your generated <strong>CSS SWf</strong> file will request those <strong>RSL</strong>s when loaded into the application via the <strong>StyleManager</strong>. Unnecessary overhead as they those <strong>RSL</strong>s are already in the application domain and the request becomes moot.</p>
<p>So, long story long, <strong><a href="http://github.com/bustardcelly/flex-runtime-css" target="_blank">flex-runtime-css</a></strong> intends to address this issue by providing a custom configuration that does away with the <strong>RSL</strong> linking and externally compiles against the framework libraries. A <strong>CSS SWF</strong> can be generated using the <strong>flex-runtime-css</strong> files and ANT. If you use the <strong><a href="http://github.com/bustardcelly/flex-runtime-css" taget="_blank">flex-runtime-css</a></strong> you will need to update the build.properties file included in the project to point to the <strong>Flex SDK</strong> and file resources on your local disk.</p>
