Updated my [ImagesLoader](http://custardbelly.com/blog/?p=43) classes to flash9…  
My mind is completely [boggled](http://i12.photobucket.com/albums/a239/djrecon83/pingpong5ah.jpg) by[ FC64.](http://codeazur.com.br/stuff/fc64/)…  
[DS Mario Bros](http://www.gamespot.com/ds/action/supermariobrosds/index.html) comin out…

Also… [Josh Tynjala over at zeuslabs ](http://www.zeuslabs.us/)( i highly recommend checking out his AS3 [particlesystem experiments](http://www.zeuslabs.us/archives/63/introduction-to-particle-systems-using-actionscript-3/) ) had recently [posted a porting question](http://www.zeuslabs.us/archives/64/actionscript-3-handling-inheritance/#comments) involving heritance issues and i struck up an example that may have proved helpful… thought i’d post them here as well.

It basically is an [example](http://custardbelly.com/AS3/FruitApp/srcview/index.html) on how to use interfaces and “AS3 abstract” classes to call methods between different subclass implementations. [ download the zip here](http://www.custardbelly.com/downloads/as3/FruitExample.zip).

And i gotta throw up something i’ve been porting on my own … [strip example](javascript:MM_openBrWindow('http://www.custardbelly.com/blog/files/StripExample/index.html','stripExample','resizable=no,width=300,height=100');)
