		<p><em><strong>as3flobile</strong> is a set of ActionScript 3 components targeting the Flash Player on Mobile Devices, whether it be embedded in the browser or in an Adobe AIR application. You find out more about the project at <a href="http://github.com/bustardcelly/as3flobile" target="_blank">http://github.com/bustardcelly/as3flobile</a>.</em></p>
<p>What with the latest <a href="http://business-news.thestreet.com/link/?http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2010/09/09statement.html;;;http://business-news.thestreet.com/business/2010/09/09/a/692864524-statement-by-apple-on-app/;;;http://business-news.thestreet.com/business/2010/09/09/a/692864524-statement-by-apple-on-app/" target="_blank">breaking news on rollback of restrictions for iOS application submissions</a>, i decided to set some time to drop the <strong>as3flobile</strong> components into an AIR app and publish with the <strong>pfi</strong>. They work great and actually are quite a bit more responsive (go figure!) in regards to both animation and touch response (due to hardware i suppose).</p>
<p>The <strong>as3flobile</strong> project actually started out as a way to play around with <strong>Flash</strong> on the <strong>iPhone</strong>, but shifted to a suite a components targeting mobile devices that supported the <strong>Flash Player</strong> in browser (i forget why the focused changed <img src="http://custardbelly.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley"> ). In any event, i just wanted to write a quick post that, yes, you can use <strong>as3flobile</strong> components in an AIR application on Android and now iOS… (well, i guess it was always possible, just never a strong possibility that anyone would be able to see it unless you added them to your provision <img src="http://custardbelly.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley"> ).</p>
<p>If you are interested, the <a href="http://github.com/bustardcelly/as3flobile" target="_blank"><strong>as3flobile</strong> project is available on github</a>, so check it out.</p>
<p>Here’s also a great <a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/cantrell/archives/2010/09/packager-for-iphone-refresher.html" target="_blank">refresher post on the <strong>PFI</strong></a> by <a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/cantrell/" target="_blank">Christian Cantrell</a>.</p>
