		<p><a href="http://thefactoryfactory.com/wordpress/" target="_blank">Josh Noble</a> – the main man behind the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Flex-Cookbook-Code-Recipes-Developers-Developer/dp/0596529856/ref=pd_sim_b_2" target="_blank">Flex 3 Cookbook</a> of which i had the esteem pleasure of being part of (thanks again, j-man) – has <a href="http://thefactoryfactory.com/wordpress/?p=435">recently blogged</a> about some more information involving the files for download and the intention of the book.</p>
<p>Wanted to blog about it as well, as i feel there is some great information from his post about the decision for cutting chapters and where to download code and the best way to submit errata. He also mentions the heartbreaking decision to cut chapters and recipes from the book to preserve page count… but don’t put the book back on the shelf, they are available to download!</p>
<p>We hope people are enjoying the book at what any level developer you are. Cheers to Josh and happy coding!</p>
