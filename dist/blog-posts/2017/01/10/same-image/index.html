    <p>I am attempting to draw the same image, every day, all year. Check it out: <a href="https://bustardcelly.github.io/same-image-2017/" alt="Same Image 2017" target="_blank">https://bustardcelly.github.io/same-image-2017/</a></p>

<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>I started this project on the first day of the new year (2017), and I have to confess: on the 16th day of the new year, I already <strong>despise</strong> the picture I chose to draw every day, <em>ALL YEAR</em>. That is expected, and truthfully my uneasiness of having to produce something related to this picture began around the 5th day into it; I didn&#39;t think it would happen that early... but it was bound to happen.</p>
<h1 id="why-">Why?</h1>
<h2 id="tl-dr">tl;dr</h2>
<p>It&#39;s an old exercise of being forced to produce something as a result of another, repetitively. It causes waves of fascination and disgust, but hopefully will boil down to its essence through lucidity and loss of ego, at times... that is still yet to be seen at the time of this writing.</p>
<h2 id="long-version">long version</h2>
<p>I get too caught up in everything being perfect before I show something, say something, do something. Terrible habit. I am hoping this exercise will allow me to realize: I can&#39;t make it perfect before it goes out the door, but maybe I can learn something to make it better at a later time. I need to make something, no matter how much I dislike it, show it, own up to it, and trust I can learn from it to use that knowledge to create something that I think is of better quality.</p>
<p>Art is obviously subjective, and taste is always in the eye of the beholder. What if I am holding stuff I produce to the standard of <em>only</em> what I want to see? What if all these really horrible drawings that I am making are actually &quot;art&quot; to someone else? I doubt that whomever likes my horrible drawings from this experiment will ever find them, but what the hell: I&#39;ll put them out there.</p>
<p>All in all, I think it might be a fun way to not be so tied to perfection and also get back into my roots. <em>Though I have been fascinated with computers and programming for the last 15+ years, I actually hold a Fine Arts degree. Go figure.</em></p>
<h1 id="what-">What?</h1>
<p>I really just chose a picture of a memory with my daughter that brings me joy. The picture and memory won&#39;t be ruined by my terrible, terrible representation of it. And in some respects, I guess that is why I chose the picture that I did. Perhaps, at the end of the year, I will also post the picture that I have been drawing from.</p>
<h1 id="how-">How?</h1>
<p>No rules. I can use whatever medium I want. I can focus on the smallest minutia I decide at the time. It doesn&#39;t even have to be a realistic representation.</p>
<p>No rules. I just have to think or look at the image every day and produce something. Anything.</p>
<h1 id="where-">Where?</h1>
