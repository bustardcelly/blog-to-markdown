		<p>I recently switched from my current host, to a dedicated server and i couldn’t be happier.</p>
<p>I was fairly happy with my current shared-hosting plan ( though reading <a href="http://aralbalkan.com/753" target="_blank">Aral’s problems</a> started to make we think twice ), but i have increasingly wanted more out of an online server that my current host just couldn’t provide. So i purchased a virtual private server from Westhost. So far, i have had no complaints, they are attentive to any pointless questions i may have, and the forums are an endless supply of knowledge. I have yet to move all my content from my current host over, so that’s a task i don’t look forward to…</p>
<p>Now i’m getting comfortable with linux commands and installing crap here and there, and starting up this and that, and having a ball, and drinking way too much fountain soda – but big ups to <a href="http://razorberry.com/blog" target="_blank">Ash</a> for holding back the temptation to <a href="http://www.morechickenandtuna.net/albums/2cats/smack.jpg" target="_blank">smack me</a> due to my incessant questions.</p>
<p>I have to say, the main ingredient that caused this push to a vps is <a href="http://osflash.org/red5" target="_blank">Red5</a> ( if you are unfamiliar with red5, there are more links at the bottom of this post ). I have been checking-out the <a href="http://svn1.cvsdude.com/osflash/red5/java/server/trunk/" target="_blank">source</a> and not touching Red5 since release 0.4, so i was in good shape to know nothing about it when rc0.6 came out… enter <a href="http://blog.ff9900.org/" target="_blank">Chris Allen</a> into our <a href="http://schematic.com" target="_blank">Boston office</a> and he gives a great presentation onRed5, sparking my interest to really buckle down and play with it. If you or your company are at all interested in what <a href="http://osflash.org/red5" target="_blank">Red5</a> can provide for your business, i wouldn’t hesitate to get in touch with <a href="http://blog.ff9900.org/" target="_blank">Chris.</a></p>
<p>Things were touch and go a little with running Red5 on my new server ( again big-ups to <a href="http://razorberry.com/blog" target="_blank">Ash</a> ), but i eventually abandoned running apps on a built Red5 server and switched to deploying it under Tomcat. Oh boy! No problems yet and i am like a kid in a candy store. And with the current development on closing ghost connections, i’m ecstatic. Their <a href="http://dl.fancycode.com/red5/api/">API</a> is rock solid, can only get better, and i am finally thinking in Java on my own after reading numerous books and doing countless tutorials.</p>
<p>I’ve been playing with AS3, Java and Red5 lately and have something up and running, but i’m re-working the code and rebuffing the appearance… hope to have it up soon. I may throw up some directions and trials and tribulations of setting up the server, if anyone is interested. Until then – </p>
