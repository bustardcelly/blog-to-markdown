This is just a quick post to alert any subscribers to this blog that are interested in JavaScript development that I created a [repository some time back on github](https://github.com/bustardcelly/massroute-js) that holds my exploration of various JavaScript frameworks and libraries. You can check it out at [http://github.com/bustardcelly/massroute-js](https://github.com/bustardcelly/massroute-js).

Centered around the theme of developing a web-based application to access real-time MBTA transportation data (made available by [MassDOT](http://www.twitter.com/MassDOTdev) – [more info here](http://www.eot.state.ma.us/developers/realtime/)), I wanted to explore various libraries and micro-application frameworks that are out in-the-wild for JavaScript; some more well-known than others, but still hold my interest.

The initial commit included the work i had done with jQuery Mobile, which i have been actively working with for almost a year and have given a couple [presentation](http://www.slideshare.net/todd_anderson/jquery-mobile-progressive-enhancement-with-html5-8302294)s on. Most recently, I committed an example of my exploration into [dojo](http://dojotoolkit.org/). I rather enjoyed working with the dojo framework and toolkit and hope to have another post that spotlights my experience working with it – actually i hope to post on each library/framework that i dig into with the repo, so we’ll see how that goes. Next up on my curiosity list is [Knockout](http://knockoutjs.com/)…

I won’t list all those that have caught my eye, so if you have any suggestions please feel free to leave them in the comments.

**[Disclaimer]**  
If you look at the source of the examples in the repo, I don’t claim to be a master of the library or frameworks I am exploring, needless to say the JavaScript language itself. So, if you see something that is considered bad practice or all together wrong, please let me know.
