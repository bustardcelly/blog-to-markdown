		<p>My mom had some LP’s lying around, played them in the living room while cooking dinner. My best friend Tim Costello wouldn’t let me in a word edge-wise when he started talking about <em><strong>Blonde on Blonde</strong> </em>at the age of 15. I wore out every cassette i had of his in my son-appropriated, mom’s old ‘87 grand-am that ran like squirrels were kicking the fan-belt. I’m a huge fan. Books upon records upon memories upon making me believe i know who i am.<br>
Backed by Martin Scorsese (director of <em>The Last Waltz</em> starring the Band – another huge influence on me -), the first part of the two-part series <a href="http://www.pbs.org/previews/american_masters_dylan/">No Direction Home</a> on PBS has just finished, which prompted me throwing on the LP’s i stole from my mom over scattered visits home.<br>
Still fresh. Still harrowing. Still hopeful. Still making me wish i didn’t talk about Bob Dylan like some cliche’d Bob Dylan fan… ah, well.</p>
