		<p>What would you say is that one variable/method name you are just itching for the right project to come along so you can use?</p>
<p>I posed this question to my friend and co-worker, <a href="http://www.razorberry.com/blog">Ash</a>, and he replied with an answer that was so practical , but at the same time euphemistic, that i was rolling on the floor. It was almost used as a flag in an app that utilizes the drawingAPI… penIsDown. </p>
<p>I was thinking more along the lines of something that would only have context in that one particlular app. Something like <strong>private function tiltFez()</strong> or <strong>public var monkeyFreckle</strong>…</p>
<p>… but what Ash said was just classic, and i want to hear what other people got.</p>
<p>Leave a comment for what yours is… try to keep it clean.</p>
