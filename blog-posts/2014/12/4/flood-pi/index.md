A lot has happened over the course current year. Among the biggest changes, we left Boston for Vermont! We have begun to settle in here in the beatuiful Champlain Valley and, of course, my oldest is enrolled in hockey lessons - a sport i know very little about, but am excited to learn from him.

As is expected from a big move, we have found outselves in different surroundings and different living spaces. We are no longer 4 people cramped in a tiny 2-bedroom condo along the train line in Brighton, MA; we are now 4 people in a ranch house with noone above or below us to complain about taking off their loud shoes when the baby is sleeping. 

While the extra space of a house is wonderful, tit comes with additional maintenance and care over renting an apartment. For instance, we never had a basement in our previous apartments and never had to worry about flooding or failures in a sump pump. Now we do. And we have had a handful of instances when it has occurred. While it is true that we have and will continue to have qualified people locate the source of the problem, I thought - in the meantime - it would be a fun little project to setup something that could alert me to possible water starting to accumulate in the basement.

And from that [flood-pi](https://github.com/bustardcelly/flood-pi) was born!
