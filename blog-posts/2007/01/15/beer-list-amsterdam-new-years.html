		<p>I was sending around an email of the wife and i’s comprised beer tasting list while we were in <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/91582541@N00/sets/72157594462173687/">Amsterdam</a>, and thought i’d post it here, as well- for people who love beer or think we’ve made a mistake on our ruling.</p>
<p>Here it goes:</p>
<p><strong>Strongbow</strong> :: 0 stars – 1st beer tasted off the plane! Stay away… stay far away! no stars. didn’t deter our spirits.</p>
<p><strong>Hertog Jan</strong>. <em>Prestige</em>. :: 4 stars! 2nd beer… and tasted at a later date to confirm. Oh. like sitting on a rainbow. Excellent. Dark, welcoming.</p>
<p><strong>LaChouffe</strong> :: 3 1/2 stars. Wonderful blonde beer that screams welcome to Amsterdam. On tap, also, at our local Boston pub. Visit, damn you.</p>
<p><strong>Witbier</strong> :: 2 stars. Translates into White beer. I’ve never been fond. Carrie ordered it… sucker!</p>
<p><strong>Westmalle Dubbel</strong> :: 3 stars. No comments left in our book. Either it was late or just tasted damn good.</p>
<p><strong>Palm Dubbel</strong> :: 2 1/2 stars. This is on tap in a lot of bars in Amsterdam. Had to try it. It’s good, darn good. But there were too many better choices.</p>
<p><strong>BockRos</strong>   :: 3 stars. Served from the brewery of ‘De Bekeerde Suster’, of which the resteraunt we ate at 2 times. Excellent homebrew. Dark and slightly red.</p>
<p><strong>Dommelsch</strong> :: 2 stars. Can be found in most bars in Amsterdam. Okay. Your basic Pilsner.</p>
<p><strong>Affligem Dubbel</strong> :: 3 1/2 . Oh, Affligem. Like a welcoming hug, i say, hello, friend… a game of hopscotch? Excellent.</p>
<p><strong>LaChouffe N’Ice </strong>:: 4 stars! If you see this on tap, do not look farther down the line… say yes, then ‘gimme’. Then sigh. Ah. LaChouffe, did God make you?</p>
<p><strong>Gulpener </strong>:: 2 1/2 stars. Seen at most bars, like Dommelsch and Palm. It’s a pilsner. If you only have those three choices… Gulpener it is!</p>
<p><strong>Zatte</strong> :: 2 stars. This was a toss up. Personally we didn’t like it. Citrusy, but not sweet. We could see how if someone likes citrus beer, this would be key. Stars variable.</p>
<p><strong>Heinekken</strong> :: 2 stars! Normally this would get 1 star state-side, but it seriously tastes better over there. Not as skunky. Go figure… still if anything else is on tap, get it.</p>
<p><strong>Grolsch</strong> :: 2 stars. Tastes like state-side grolsch. Good. If nothing, or heinekken is left in the cooler, grab this.</p>
<p><strong>Affligem Blonde</strong> :: 3 strars. See above affligem.. instead of hopscotch – jumprope.</p>
<p><strong>BlondeRos</strong> :: 2 1/2 stars. Another selection from ‘De Bekeerde Suster’ ( see BockRos ), but we like darker beers. It’s good, but if Ros is on tap…</p>
<p><strong>Venloosch Alt</strong> :: 1 star. This is weird. It may have tasted good if it didn’t taste flat. Maybe it wasn’t flat… we just don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>Lindebloom</strong> :: 1 star. I took a HUGE dump in this bar, cause i couldn’t wait to get to our favorite bar. And the bathroom was seriously the size of a freaking phone booth. Couldn’t even sit on the pot. But lord it was a relief. Anyway, i ordered this. Wasn’t good. Like the logo though.</p>
<p><strong>Amstel Bock </strong>:: 2 stars. Our last night cap. Was freaking amazing to have, but didn’t taste as good as many others. Definitely better than amstel though!</p>
<p>Time between the Venloosch/Lindebloom incedent and Amstel Bock was @ two days, so we didn’t end on a bad note. We certainly headed back to where we knew LaChouffe, Affligem and Hertog Jan were flowing… Can’t wait to go back.</p>
<p>If you get a chance, please see what you can do to get to Amsterdam.</p>
