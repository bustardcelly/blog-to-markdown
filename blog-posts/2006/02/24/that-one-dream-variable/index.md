What would you say is that one variable/method name you are just itching for the right project to come along so you can use?

I posed this question to my friend and co-worker, [Ash](http://www.razorberry.com/blog), and he replied with an answer that was so practical , but at the same time euphemistic, that i was rolling on the floor. It was almost used as a flag in an app that utilizes the drawingAPI… penIsDown. 

I was thinking more along the lines of something that would only have context in that one particlular app. Something like **private function tiltFez()** or **public var monkeyFreckle**…

… but what Ash said was just classic, and i want to hear what other people got.

Leave a comment for what yours is… try to keep it clean.
