		<p>First off… <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/91582541@N00/sets/72157594462173687/" target="_blank">best new years ever – Amsterdam</a>. Beautiful city. Would move there in a New York minute…</p>
<p>What will come of this new year? I’ve been insanely busy with work and my wonderful family. I’ve also been mulling over what i want to look back on come this time 2008. I’ve been wanting to sink my teeth into something for a little while now, and am proud of my personal and professional work of 2006, but i’m stumbling around wanting something that will click. Truthfully i should just shut my mind off, spin some records and code.</p>
<p>I got heavily into <a href="http://osflash.org/red5">Red5</a> prior to the new year and was having a blast. It actually led into working more with Java and Flex – which makes Red5 a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/91582541@N00/347295583/in/set-72157594462173687/" target="_blank">gateway drug</a> – but I don’t want to show anything because i’m too much of a perfectionist and i don’t think it’s quite right… bah. Got a <a href="http://www.makezine.com/controller/" target="_blank">MAKE Controller</a> for the holidays, and only just two days ago set it up… hopefully more will come of that – big ups to <a href="http://www.thefactoryfactory.com/wordpress/" target="_blank">Josh Noble</a> who’s gonna hear my incessant questions.</p>
<p>I dunno. I’m just searching for something… and part of it probably has to do with experiencing a new culture and the passing of someone i held dear to my heart and thought the world of. </p>
<p>Now i’m gonna shut up and spin some records.</p>
