	<div class="entry-content full-content">
		<p><a href="http://schematic.com/">Schematic</a> has opened a new office in Boston, and i am happy to announce that i have accepted a position there and looking forward to working alongside some extremely talented people.<br>
Just finishing up some documentation on the numerous projects and products i have worked on as an xplanaPloyee, and am anxious to get my hands dirty with a different and exciting company and get back to some personal projects i’ve put on hold ( cause of a <a href="http://custardbelly.com/blog/?p=54">wonderfully busy month</a> ).</p>
<p>Also celebrating a birthday Monday- so if anyone out there is going to the <a href="http://www.myspace.com/theofficialradiobirdman">Radio Birdman</a> show on Saturday, buy me a beer.</p>
