# [Flex 4 Cookbook Coming Soon!](http://custardbelly.com/blog/2010/03/24/flex-4-cookbook-coming-soon/)

[![Flex 4 Cookbook](http://custardbelly.com/blog/images/cookbook.jpg)](http://www.amazon.com/Flex-Cookbook-Real-world-developing-Applications/dp/0596805616/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1269336661&sr=8-5)Following the announcement of the [**Flex 4 SDK** release](http://www.adobe.com/products/flex/), i thought i would mention a little something about a publication i have had the pleasure to be apart of (again! Big ups to [Josh](http://thefactoryfactory.com/wordpress/)). The **Flex 4 Cookbook** from [O’Reilly Media](http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596805623) is expected to be dropped on May 15th 2010 and you can [pre-order yours](http://www.amazon.com/Flex-Cookbook-Real-world-developing-Applications/dp/0596805616/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1269336661&sr=8-5) (and your loved one’s) today.

With the paradigm shifts in architecture from Flex 3 to Flex 4, the **Flex 4 Cookbook** is hardly an _‘updated’_ version of the last. I had the pleasure i’ve diving deeper into the new SDK along side some extremely talented folks. [Josh](http://thefactoryfactory.com/wordpress/) and I snagged [Garth Braithwaite](http://www.garthdb.com/#) (of [InsideRIA](http://www.insideria.com/) and Flash Community fame) and <del>forced</del> asked him to contribute his knowledge and expertise and we also snatched up [David Tucker](http://www.davidtucker.net/), [Rich Tretola](http://blog.everythingflex.com/) and [Marco Casario](http://casario.blogs.com/) of the [Adobe AIR 1.5 Cookbook](http://www.amazon.com/Adobe-AIR-1-5-Cookbook-Application/dp/0596522509/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1269436452&sr=1-1) and dedicated a few chapters to Adobe AIR 2.0. 

What could come of such a stellar line-up? More pages of writing than can be published that has been gratefully edited down to coherent sentences by the O’Reilly publishing team. And maybe a few laughs.

This is a huge step in the Flex 4 SDK and, in my opinion, a much needed step and the correct vision of the future of development for the Flash Platform. The Flex 4 engineers did an amazing job and i highly recommend [downloading the SDK](http://opensource.adobe.com/wiki/display/flexsdk/Download+Flex+4) and playing around. The separation of responsibilities within the new Spark component architecture is a huge boost in my workflow and a stellar achievement.
