# [Flash And The City: jQuery Mobile](http://custardbelly.com/blog/2011/06/15/flash-and-the-city-jquery-mobile/)

Over the past weekend, I had the great pleasure to attend and present at [Flash And The City](http://fatc.co/) in NYC. I want to thank [Elad](https://twitter.com/#!/eladelrom) and [Jose](https://twitter.com/#!/joseeight) for putting on an excellent conference and giving me an opportunity to present.

The talk was about the [jQuery Mobile](http://jquerymobile.com/) framework and was sort of a nuts and bolts overview of what the framework has to offer and its foundation on the principal of [Progressive Enhancement](http://www.alistapart.com/articles/understandingprogressiveenhancement). Thanks to all who made it out. I really appreciate it and hopefully it was worth taking you away from the beautiful city for a little bit.

You can also check out a loose transcript of what i *may* have said here: [jQuery Mobile: Progressive Enhancement with HTML5 [FATC 2011] transcript](http://www.custardbelly.com/presentations/FATC/jqm/FATC_jQM_Transcript.pdf). [**Warning** - its a PDF] 

There were more slides than the time allotted and I didn’t want to keep those who were nice enough to attend from exploring the city by watching me ramble on over my time limit. So i can’t guarantee that the transcript was true to the presentation; it was more of a rough draft of my thoughts on the slides.

All the demo source code and a PDF of the slide-deck can be downloaded here as well:
