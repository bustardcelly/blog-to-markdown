I had the great pleasure to be interviewed on RIARadio and be in the company of [**Garth Braithwaite**](http://www.garthdb.com/), [**Stacey Mulcahy**](http://bitchwhocodes.com/mt/), [**Leif Wells**](http://www.leifwells.com/index.cfm) and [**Josh (oooahhh) Noble**](http://thefactoryfactory.com/wordpress/). Thanks for having me on! I had a great time and i sound pretty good in the reverse auto-tune affect that Garth put on my voice so as to sound like a nasally jersey kid.

You can listen to the podcast up on **InsideRIA** -> [RIARadio Episode 15: Flex 4 Cookbook](http://bit.ly/9hpMLx).

**ps.** If you listen and are confused as to what **Josh** looks like, here is a picture of him ->  
![Joshoooaahhh Noble](http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l2kx4yk7n51qajg12o1_500.jpg)  
That’s him on the shark… obviously, someone shopped in the grenade launcher but a nice picture of him from his good side, nonetheless. So if you see him at **[FlashBelt](http://www.flashbelt.com/)**, say hello for me!

**pps.** [**Flex 4 Cookbook** is dropping soon!](http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596805623) go pick up a copy and read it with a loved one on Memorial Day.
