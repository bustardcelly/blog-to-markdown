# [oh stop it… you shouldn’t have](http://custardbelly.com/blog/2005/09/08/oh-stop-it-you-shouldnt-have/)

what can i say. the online gaming automated spam commenter loves my site! really, i thought my blog was mediocre at best, but the ego boost from a faceless internet nomad has brightened my day. i’ve seen it on other blogs and they just tell me to play, Play, PLAY; but my web-oriented flier-under-the-wiper “readers” … they like me… the really like me!  
finally something gets me. Thank you Gioco Texas holdem (can i call you GTH’em?), you’re very flattering- glad you like the blog! and really, ‘Texas hold’em en ligne’… i try my best, but thank you!  
i might keep the comments up for another day or two, just until my strut starts hurting my knee.
