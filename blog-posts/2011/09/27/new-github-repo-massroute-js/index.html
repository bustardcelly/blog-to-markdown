		<p>This is just a quick post to alert any subscribers to this blog that are interested in JavaScript development that I created a <a href="https://github.com/bustardcelly/massroute-js" target="_blank">repository some time back on github</a> that holds my exploration of various JavaScript frameworks and libraries. You can check it out at <a href="https://github.com/bustardcelly/massroute-js" target="_blank">http://github.com/bustardcelly/massroute-js</a>.</p>
<p>Centered around the theme of developing a web-based application to access real-time MBTA transportation data (made available by <a href="http://www.twitter.com/MassDOTdev" target="_blank">MassDOT</a> – <a href="http://www.eot.state.ma.us/developers/realtime/" target="_blank">more info here</a>), I wanted to explore various libraries and micro-application frameworks that are out in-the-wild for JavaScript; some more well-known than others, but still hold my interest.</p>
<p>The initial commit included the work i had done with jQuery Mobile, which i have been actively working with for almost a year and have given a couple <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/todd_anderson/jquery-mobile-progressive-enhancement-with-html5-8302294" target="_blank">presentation</a>s on. Most recently, I committed an example of my exploration into <a href="http://dojotoolkit.org/" target="_blank">dojo</a>. I rather enjoyed working with the dojo framework and toolkit and hope to have another post that spotlights my experience working with it – actually i hope to post on each library/framework that i dig into with the repo, so we’ll see how that goes. Next up on my curiosity list is <a href="http://knockoutjs.com/" target="_blank">Knockout</a>…</p>
<p>I won’t list all those that have caught my eye, so if you have any suggestions please feel free to leave them in the comments.</p>
<p><strong>[Disclaimer]</strong><br>
If you look at the source of the examples in the repo, I don’t claim to be a master of the library or frameworks I am exploring, needless to say the JavaScript language itself. So, if you see something that is considered bad practice or all together wrong, please let me know.</p>
