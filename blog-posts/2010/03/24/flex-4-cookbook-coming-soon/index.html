		<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Flex-Cookbook-Real-world-developing-Applications/dp/0596805616/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1269336661&amp;sr=8-5"><img src="http://custardbelly.com/blog/images/cookbook.jpg" alt="Flex 4 Cookbook"></a>Following the announcement of the <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/flex/"><strong>Flex 4 SDK</strong> release</a>, i thought i would mention a little something about a publication i have had the pleasure to be apart of (again! Big ups to <a href="http://thefactoryfactory.com/wordpress/">Josh</a>). The <strong>Flex 4 Cookbook</strong> from <a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596805623">O’Reilly Media</a> is expected to be dropped on May 15th 2010 and you can <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Flex-Cookbook-Real-world-developing-Applications/dp/0596805616/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1269336661&amp;sr=8-5">pre-order yours</a> (and your loved one’s) today.</p>
<p>With the paradigm shifts in architecture from Flex 3 to Flex 4, the <strong>Flex 4 Cookbook</strong> is hardly an <em>‘updated’</em> version of the last. I had the pleasure i’ve diving deeper into the new SDK along side some extremely talented folks. <a href="http://thefactoryfactory.com/wordpress/">Josh</a> and I snagged <a href="http://www.garthdb.com/#">Garth Braithwaite</a> (of <a href="http://www.insideria.com/">InsideRIA</a> and Flash Community fame) and <del datetime="2010-03-24T12:55:33+00:00">forced</del> asked him to contribute his knowledge and expertise and we also snatched up <a href="http://www.davidtucker.net/">David Tucker</a>, <a href="http://blog.everythingflex.com/">Rich Tretola</a> and <a href="http://casario.blogs.com/">Marco Casario</a> of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Adobe-AIR-1-5-Cookbook-Application/dp/0596522509/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1269436452&amp;sr=1-1">Adobe AIR 1.5 Cookbook</a> and dedicated a few chapters to Adobe AIR 2.0. </p>
<p>What could come of such a stellar line-up? More pages of writing than can be published that has been gratefully edited down to coherent sentences by the O’Reilly publishing team. And maybe a few laughs.</p>
<p>This is a huge step in the Flex 4 SDK and, in my opinion, a much needed step and the correct vision of the future of development for the Flash Platform. The Flex 4 engineers did an amazing job and i highly recommend <a href="http://opensource.adobe.com/wiki/display/flexsdk/Download+Flex+4">downloading the SDK</a> and playing around. The separation of responsibilities within the new Spark component architecture is a huge boost in my workflow and a stellar achievement.</p>
