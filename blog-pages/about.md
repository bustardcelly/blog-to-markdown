I am an application developer with a passion for architecture and development workflows.

A strong proponent of agile practices and Test Driven Development, with over a decade of experience I have helped deliver web, mobile and desktop solutions with numerous companies in the enterprise and entertainment industries including Adobe, THQ, Cond√© Nast Publications and Motorola.

I write frequently about software and technology on my [blog](http://custardbelly.com/blog), support Open Source software and due my best to give back to the development community through [github](https://github.com/bustardcelly) and have had the esteemed pleasure to be a co-author on several titles from O'Reilly and Wiley Wrox: [amazon profile](http://www.amazon.com/Todd-Anderson/e/B0037FMULM/ref=ntt_athr_dp_pel_2).

**Have some crazy ideas or exciting new opportunities? I'd love to hear about them!**
