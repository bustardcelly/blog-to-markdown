i had a life story written of how i started out trying to make games in flash, but i was getting blah blah, so – in short – much credit to[ tonypa](http://www.tonypa.pri.ee/tbw/index.html), [out of society](http://oos.moxiecode.com/) and [Keith Peters](http://bit-101.com) for getting my feet wet. online there was very little resources for creating games based on OOP (though [steve](http://video-animation.com/mx2k_00.shtml) has some excellent tutorials) so i tried to marry my practices used at work with that of what was available on the internet *mostly in AS1.  
plus my mind wonders pretty frequently, so to follow a whole tutorial is hard. i tend to get through about 1/5 of it, stop looking at it, (maybe throw on [Heaven Tonight](http://www.cheaptrick.com/ctalbum3.html) or [Trash&Burn](http://www.deadmoonusa.com/dm_mtr390.htm)), and start trying to incorporate what i learned with what i already know, and get frustrated that nothing is working the way i want (blah blah).  
while i was making another game, i started to realize i had gotten “smarter” (all thanks to Keith, [Sam](http://blog.pixelconsumption.com) and [Colby](http://colbygrenier.com)) and thought i throw something up here for anybody that is in the same boat i am – trying to make sense of making games in Flash using OOP principles instead of the timeline and symbol-based functions.

First up: the basic Hero. i only call it the Hero because it reacts to user controls like the keyboard, though i could be proven wrong. 

download it [here](http://custardbelly.com/downloads/hero_trial.zip) and have a look around.  
if any of you have a different approach or any questions, leave a comment. i am terrible at commenting my code so…  
and here is a short list of people and sites you should really check out:

[tonypa](http://www.tonypa.pri.ee/tbw/index.html)  
[andré michelle](http://void.andre-michelle.com/)  
[video-animation](http://video-animation.com/mx2k_00.shtml)  
[out of society](http://oos.moxiecode.com/)  
[keith peters ](http://bit-101.com)  
[gotoAndPlay()](http://www.gotoandplay.it/)

maybe i’ll make a bigger list of resources some day.
