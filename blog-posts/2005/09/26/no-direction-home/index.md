My mom had some LP’s lying around, played them in the living room while cooking dinner. My best friend Tim Costello wouldn’t let me in a word edge-wise when he started talking about _**Blonde on Blonde** _at the age of 15. I wore out every cassette i had of his in my son-appropriated, mom’s old ‘87 grand-am that ran like squirrels were kicking the fan-belt. I’m a huge fan. Books upon records upon memories upon making me believe i know who i am.  
Backed by Martin Scorsese (director of _The Last Waltz_ starring the Band – another huge influence on me -), the first part of the two-part series [No Direction Home](http://www.pbs.org/previews/american_masters_dylan/) on PBS has just finished, which prompted me throwing on the LP’s i stole from my mom over scattered visits home.  
Still fresh. Still harrowing. Still hopeful. Still making me wish i didn’t talk about Bob Dylan like some cliche’d Bob Dylan fan… ah, well.

Now if we can only get some coverage of [Jim Croce](http://www.jimcroce.com/discography.html)…
