		<p>i have been testing out my old stuff with the <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/software/flashplayer/public_beta/">player 8 beta</a>. i thought i’d dig around for some poorly coded fractal trials i was heavily into back in the winter when i was addicted to <a href="http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/~pbourke/fractals/">paul bourke’s</a> work.</p>
<p>these were swfs i made that mostly give me that alert of how my movie is running slow and whether or not i would like to stop running it.</p>
<p>eventually i cleaned them up enough so that it hangs roughly right before i get that alert, but still i would have to wait @ 10 seconds before anything happened.</p>
<p>i was very pleased when i pushed them through 8 and cut my time in more than half… until i got to my mandelbrot swf- it wouldn’t even start iterating.<br>
so i poked around, set intervals, tried to fill in textboxes with the current iteration- still nothing.</p>
<p>then i went down to the line that started it all…</p>
<p><strong>onLoad = startMandelbrot;<br>
//where startManelbrot is a function that does the iteration</strong></p>
<p>don’t ask me why i used an onLoad for the timeline, i think i picked it from somewhere.<br>
with this using player 7, what it did was allow the swf to appear in the browser before it did any work. taking this out and replacing it with just<strong> startMandelbrot();</strong> would leave the browser comletely empty until it ran through the iteration.<br>
with player 8, however, <strong>onLoad </strong>was never triggered. </p>
<p>now, it could be the case that i never should have done that in the first place ( i certainly haven’t done something like that in a while ), but i wonder why it worked using player 7 and not using player 8.</p>
