Originally a resolution for 2012, then 2013, I am making good early this year on getting rid of my reliance on WordPress as my blog engine - in fact, getting rid of _any_ engine to manage and serve blog posts; I converted all my old posts to static files and will be writing posts in markdown from now on.
