<p>I recently decided to put this site under HTTPS after reading this article/interview with <a href="https://helloanselm.com/">Anselm Hannemann</a> on <strong>CSS-Tricks</strong>:</p>
<p>&gt; <a href="https://css-tricks.com/interview-web-security" target="_blank">https://css-tricks.com/interview-web-security/</a></p>
<p>I had already been interested in moving to HTTPS with the advent of an open Certificate Authority, <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let&#39;s Encrypt</a>, and my growing fascination with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API">Service Workers</a>, which will only work under HTTPS. Not sure if I would ever have a need for offline support for this site, but it never could hurt to mess around.</p>
<p>In any event, I had decided it was time to explore putting <a href="https://www.custardbelly.com/blog" target="_blank">custardbelly.com</a> under HTTPS - please don&#39;t poke around, it needs a major update - and as I went about trying to set <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/" target="_blank">Let&#39;s Encrypt</a> up on my current (<em>now old</em>) VPS host I was running into road blocks of predetermined OS&#39;es and dependencies that were beyond my control, which can happen if you entrust hosting your domains through a general VPS provider.</p>
<p>To have more control over my environment, I decided to use the Amazon Web Services (<strong>AWS</strong>) knowledge I have gained from working intimately with it in my current job/role and spin up an EC2 instance to dedicate to my site - moving it off the VPS I previously had.</p>
<p>In doing so, I wanted to share my process and experiences to any of you that may be wondering how to do the same. As the title suggests but does not entirely convey, my process involved:</p>

<h1 id="moving-a-domain-to-an-ec2-instance">Moving a Domain to an EC2 Instance</h1>
<p>This series of steps is essentially moving any files served by my previous VPS host to an EC2 instance on AWS. Because the site and its blog are all static files, it was a simple matter of moving - or rather pulling - my files to a new server.</p>
<h2 id="setting-up-an-ec2-instance">Setting up an EC2 Instance</h2>
<p>If you don&#39;t already have an Amazon Web Services (AWS) account, you can sign up for one here: <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/" target="_blank">https://aws.amazon.com/</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I wont go into any detail about what AWS is, how to set up an account and the pricing models, so please review all documentation if you are curious.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once you have signed in:</p>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to the <strong>Compute:EC2</strong> space</li>
<li>Once the <em>EC2 Dashboard</em> select <strong>Launch Instance</strong><br> <img style="width: 100%; max-width: 240px; border: 1px solid #999; padding: 10px;" src="https://www.custardbelly.com/images/https_ec2_launch_instance.png" alt="EC2 Launch Instance"></li>
<li>Select the <strong>Ubuntu Server 14.04 LTS (HVM)</strong> instance from the list of AMIs</li>
<li>Choose the <strong>t2.micro</strong> item from the <em>Instance Type</em> selection screen</li>
<li>Click <strong>Next: Configure Instance Details</strong></li>
<li>Leave the default form entries and click <strong>Next: Add Storage</strong></li>
<li>Leave the default form entries and click <strong>Next: Tag Instance</strong></li>
<li>From the <em>Key/Value</em> form, enter in the name related to your site into the <strong>Value</strong> field. In my case, I entered <code>custardbelly.com</code>, but it does not have to specifically be your domain name.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Next: Configure Security Group</strong></li>
<li>Under <em>Assign a security group</em>, select <strong>Create new security group</strong><ul>
<li>You will need to create security group with - at least - the following ports available: <code>22</code>, <code>80</code>, <code>443</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Use the <strong>Add Rule</strong> button to add protocol types and ports<br><img style="width: 100%; max-width: 360px; border: 1px solid #999; padding: 10px;" src="https://www.custardbelly.com/images/https_security_group.png" alt="EC2 Security Groups"></li>
<li>Click <strong>Review and Launch</strong></li>
<li>On the next page, accept the review and click <strong>Launch</strong></li>
<li>If you do not already have a key pair on your system through your AWS account that you want to associated with your site, then <strong>Create a new key pair</strong>; otherwise, <strong>Choose an existin key pair</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once accepting the license agreement, you should be redirected to the <em>EC2 Dashboard:Instances</em> page and see your new instance listed - most likely spinning up with an <em>Initializing...</em> note.</p>
<p>We&#39;ll wait until that is finished initializing before SSH&#39;ing into it, but before we do that, we can assign an Elastic IP to the instance so that the IP is not potentially change by AWS at any time.</p>
<h2 id="defining-an-elastic-ip">Defining an Elastic IP</h2>
<p>By associating an Elastic IP to an AWS instance, you are essentially reserving a static IP for your instance that won&#39;t change as long as it is associated in your account.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I won&#39;t go into detail about Elastic IPs, so please refer to the documentation if interested: <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/elastic-ip-addresses-eip.html" target="_blank">http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/elastic-ip-addresses-eip.html</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To assign an Elastic IP to your newly launched instance:</p>
<ol>
<li>From the <em>EC2 Dashboard</em> select the <strong>Network &amp; Security: Elastic IPs</strong> from the left-hand tree menu</li>
<li>Select <strong>Allocate New Address</strong></li>
<li>From the modal window, click <strong>Yes, Allocate</strong></li>
<li>Click on the newlly added address in the listing</li>
<li>From the <em>Actions</em> button, above the listing_, select <strong>Associate Address</strong></li>
<li>In the <em>Associate Address</em> dialog, start typing the name Value giving to the newly launched instance in the <strong>Instance</strong> field</li>
<li>Once you see the entry for your newly launched instance from the previous section, select it and fill the <strong>Instance</strong> field value<ul>
<li>In my case, that is <code>custardbelly.com</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Click <strong>Associate</strong></li>
<li>Upon association of the new Elastic IP, you should see your <strong>Instance</strong> show up in the listing entry</li>
</ol>
<p>At this point, if you navigate back to <strong>Instances:Instances</strong> from the <em>EC2 Dashboard</em>, you should see your newly launched instance listed, and the <strong>Public IP</strong> field should display the associated Elastic IP and appear in blue.</p>
<h2 id="site-files">Site Files</h2>
<p>The main site files are hand curated and live in a <a href="https://github.com/bustardcelly/custardbelly-dot-com" target="_blank">github repo</a>. The blog site is generated from markdown and has its own <a href="https://github.com/bustardcelly/blog-to-markdown" target="_blank">github repo</a>, as well; its a bit overblown for its purpose now, but at the time it was used as a tooling system to generate markdown from Wordpress post as described in <a href="https://www.custardbelly.com/blog/blog-posts/2014/01/03/so-long-wordpress/index.html" target="_blank">a previous article</a>.</p>
<p>Using the newly associated IP for the instance and the key generated, I SSH&#39;d into the box and pulled down my site sources. For example:</p>
<pre><code>$ ssh ~/<span class="hljs-preprocessor">.ssh</span>/custardbelly<span class="hljs-preprocessor">.pem</span> ubuntu@xxx<span class="hljs-preprocessor">.xxx</span><span class="hljs-preprocessor">.xxx</span><span class="hljs-preprocessor">.xxx</span>
</code></pre><p>Since this blog and the main site are static files and all it took was to do some <code>git clone</code>&#39;s on my new instance and move some things to their respective places. But first I had to install <code>git</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ <span class="hljs-built_in">sudo</span> apt-get update
$ <span class="hljs-built_in">sudo</span> apt-get install git
</code></pre><p>Once I installed <strong>git</strong> and pulled down my repos, I moved the main site files to <code>/var/www/custardbelly.com/public_html</code> and the blog files to <code>/var/www/blog</code>. Then I added a sym-link from <code>/var/www/custardbelly.com/public_html/blog</code> to <code>/var/www/blog</code>, so that whenever I needed to get updates to the blog on my server, I didn&#39;t have to fuddle about in the main site&#39;s directory.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This was a rudimentary first pass on getting my site and blog set up. In the future, I will add deployment strategies to these repositories, either in the form of a Continuous Integration server or with tools such as <a href="https://github.com/shipitjs/shipit" target="_blank">shipit</a>. Props to <a href="https://twitter.com/kylekellogg" target="_blank">Kyle Kellogg</a> on opening my eyes to it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>If you do not maintain your site in a Version Control System (VCS), you may need to go through other avenues to get your site files onto the instance...</em></p>
<p>With the site and blog files up on the new instance, it was time to tell the world to look there when they requested it.</p>

<h1 id="transferring-dns-records">Transferring DNS Records</h1>
<p>When defining DNS Records for my website, I had used the administrative control panel provided by my previous VPS host to register my domain; it was pretty straight-forward and allowed me to easily enter in the records to my domain name provider.</p>
<p>Now, when broaching the subject of Domain Name Servers (DNS) and how your browser actually resolves a request with a domain name to an IP, my eyes start to glaze over and the mind wonders. In other words, I am of no authority to actually speak on the topic so I hope you check out some of these articles for a better understanding:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System</a></li>
<li><a href="https://webhostinggeeks.com/guides/dns/" target="_blank">https://webhostinggeeks.com/guides/dns/</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EvjwlQ43_4" target="_blank">DNS Resolution, Step By Step (video)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>That said, with what little I do understand, I know I needed to associate DNS records - specifically NS values - with my domain name purchased from my current Domain Name Provider.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I use <a href="https://directnic.com/" target="_blank">directnic</a> to buy my domains, but I won&#39;t go into how you define the DNS values for your domain because I am certain it will differ from provider to provider.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Neverless, I had to go into the administrative console of my Domain Name Provider account and assign the DNS records created in the next sections using <strong>Amazon Route 53</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="amazon-route-53">Amazon Route 53</h2>
<p>Until I started investigating moving my site to an EC2 Instance so I had more control over how my site is served, I honestly never heard of <strong>Amazon Route 53</strong>. The <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/Welcome.html">dcoumentation for Amazon Route 53</a> states that it provides three main functions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Domain Registration</li>
<li>Domain Name System (DNS) service</li>
<li>Health checking</li>
</ul>
<p>I am only concerned about the DNS service side of the Route 53 as I have already purchased my domain and don&#39;t consider my site <em>critical</em> enough to set up CloudWatch for alarms on my site not being available.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When I went about moving my domain service to Amazon Route 53, I referred to the following documentation: <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/MigratingDNS.html" target="_blank">http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/MigratingDNS.html</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I won&#39;t rehash the listing of steps for what I performed from the link above, because they are pretty much what I followed. The only difference was I didn&#39;t obtain a DNS configuration from my DNS Provider and import it. Instead I:</p>
<ol>
<li>Created a new <em>Hosted Zone</em></li>
<li>Upon creation, selected <em>Create Record Set</em></li>
<li>Created a Record Set with <strong>Type: A - IPv4 Address</strong> with a value of the Elastic IP of the AWS Instance set up previously</li>
<li>Clicked <em>Create</em></li>
<li>Created a Record Set with <strong>Type: CNAME</strong> with the <code>www</code> name and a value of the naked domain</li>
<li>Clicked <em>Create</em></li>
</ol>
<p>I then had a <em>Hosted Zone</em> for <code>custardbelly.com</code> with 3 record entries for: <strong>NS</strong>, <strong>A</strong> and <strong>CNAME</strong>.</p>
<p>After creating a <em>Hosted Zone</em> in Amazon Route 53, I took the auto-generated <strong>NS</strong> values (there were 4 in total) and set those as the the <em>Nameserver</em> records for my domain on my Domain Name registrar.</p>

<h2 id="check-with-dig">Check with dig</h2>
<p>The new DNS for my domain got resolved rather quickly compared to the many times I have done this for domains before; it look about 3 minutes, but I think I got lucky. Anyway, I checked using the <code>dig</code> utility to make sure it was up and associated with the Elastic IP I assigned:</p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-variable">$ </span>dig custardbelly.com
</code></pre><p>Response:</p>

</code></pre><p>The Elastic IP associated with the AWS Instance I set up for my site is now shown as the <strong>A</strong> response from a <code>dig</code> request - the same I defined in the <strong>A</strong> field of my <em>Hosted Zone</em> record in Amazon Route 53.</p>
<hr>

<h1 id="setting-up-nginx">Setting Up nginx</h1>
<p>Even though the DNS resolves the domain to the IP assocated with the AWS Instance, there is nothing - at the moment, during this setup - to be displayed when making a request from a browser.</p>
<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<p>To install <strong>nginx</strong> on the new box, I ssh&#39;d into the box and issued the following:</p>
<pre><code>$ <span class="hljs-built_in">sudo</span> apt-get install nginx
</code></pre><p>That should install <strong>nginx</strong> and start the service, with its default configuration on port 80. I visited my site again - at <a href="http://custardbelly.com">http://custardbelly.com</a> - and saw the following page:</p>
<p><img style="width: 100%; max-width: 340px; border: 1px solid #999; padding: 10px;" alt="Default nginx page" src="https://custardbelly.com/images/https_nginx_page.png"></p>
<p>In order to point to the files I uploaded for my site, I needed to then add <code>custardbelly.com</code> to the <em>sites-available</em> and <em>sites-enabled</em> directories of the <strong>nginx</strong> configuration install.</p>
<h2 id="configuration">Configuration</h2>
<p>By default, <strong>nginx</strong> sets up the site on port 80 by defining a <em>default</em> configuration defined in <strong>/etc/nginx/sites-available</strong> and exposed in <strong>/etc/nginx/sites-enabled</strong>. In order to get nginx to point to the site files I uploaded to <strong>/var/www/custardbelly.com/public_html</strong> in a previous section of this post, I need to add a new file to <strong>/etc/nginx/sites-available</strong> and sym-link it in <strong>/etc/nginx/sites-enabled</strong>.</p>
<p>To do that, I ssh&#39;d into my box and:</p>
<pre><code>$ <span class="hljs-built_in">sudo</span> service nginx stop
$ <span class="hljs-built_in">sudo</span> touch /etc/nginx/sites-available/custardbelly.com
$ <span class="hljs-built_in">sudo</span> vim /etc/nginx/sites-available/custardbelly.com
</code></pre><p>And in <strong>vim</strong> editor, entered the following:</p>
<pre><code>server {
  listen <span class="hljs-number">80</span> default_server<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
  listen [::]:<span class="hljs-number">80</span> default_server<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>

  server_name custardbelly<span class="hljs-preprocessor">.com</span> www<span class="hljs-preprocessor">.custardbelly</span><span class="hljs-preprocessor">.com</span><span class="hljs-comment">;</span>

  root /var/www/custardbelly<span class="hljs-preprocessor">.com</span>/public_html<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
  index index<span class="hljs-preprocessor">.html</span> index<span class="hljs-preprocessor">.htm</span><span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
}
</code></pre><p>I wrote and quit out of the <strong>vim</strong> editor, then removed the <em>default</em> and added <em>custardbelly.com</em> to the <strong>sites-enabled</strong>:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo rm <span class="hljs-attribute">-f</span> /etc/nginx/sites<span class="hljs-attribute">-enabled</span>/default
$ sudo ln <span class="hljs-attribute">-s</span> /etc/nginx/sites<span class="hljs-attribute">-available</span>/custardbelly<span class="hljs-built_in">.</span>com /etc/nginx/sites<span class="hljs-attribute">-enabled</span>/custardbelly<span class="hljs-built_in">.</span>com
</code></pre><p>After adding <code>custardbelly.com</code> to the enabled site for <strong>nginx</strong> and exposed on port 80, I restarted <strong>nginx</strong>:</p>
<pre><code>$ <span class="hljs-built_in">sudo</span> service nginx start
</code></pre><p>Now navigating in a browser to <a href="http://custardbelly.com">http://custardbelly.com</a> - or its <em>www</em> domain - resulted in being served up the index page moved to <strong>/var/www/custardbelly.com/public_html/index.html</strong>.</p>
<p>With the non-secure site files setup under <strong>nginx</strong>, it was time to generate a certificate and serve the site under <strong>https</strong>.</p>
<hr>

<h1 id="generating-certificates-from-let-s-enrypt">Generating Certificates from Let&#39;s Enrypt</h1>
<p><a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let&#39;s Encrypt</a> is a relatively recent Certificate Authority (CA) that boasts being free, automated and open. Essentially, it allows you to manage certificates for your site - to be hosted under HTTPS - without having to go through a 3rd-party vendor.</p>
<p>To generate a certificate through <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let&#39;s Encrypt</a> for my domain - both naked and <strong>www</strong> - I cloned the repo and issued a cert for my &quot;standalone&quot; webserver... but first I stopped <strong>nginx</strong> again:</p>
<pre><code>$ <span class="hljs-built_in">sudo</span> service nginx stop
</code></pre><p>... then:</p>
<pre><code>$ git clone https://github<span class="hljs-preprocessor">.com</span>/letsencrypt/letsencrypt
$ cd letsencrypt
$ ./letsencrypt-auto certonly --standalone --email support@yourdomain<span class="hljs-preprocessor">.com</span> -d custardbelly<span class="hljs-preprocessor">.com</span> -d www<span class="hljs-preprocessor">.custardbelly</span><span class="hljs-preprocessor">.com</span>
</code></pre><blockquote>
<p><code>support@yourdomain.com</code> should be an actual email address at which you want to be notified in case of certificate expiration.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I then verified that the cert for <code>custardbelly.com</code> was created by issuing:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo ls /etc/letsencrypt/live/

<span class="hljs-keyword">...</span>

&gt; root root <span class="hljs-number">4096</span> Feb  <span class="hljs-number">10</span> <span class="hljs-number">19</span>:<span class="hljs-number">39</span> custardbelly.com
</code></pre><p>The <code>custardbelly.com</code> is a directory with key files to be used in defining how to provide SSL for your server in the configurations, as described in the next section.</p>
<h2 id="updating-nginx-site-configuration">Updating nginx Site Configuration</h2>
<p>Now that I generated a cert using <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let&#39;s Encrypt</a> to be able to serve my site under HTTPS, it was time to update the site configuration for <strong>nginx</strong>.</p>
<p>I opened up my <strong>/etc/nginx/sites-available/custardbelly.com</strong> file and edited it to include a redirect to HTTPS:</p>
<pre><code>server {
  listen <span class="hljs-number">80</span> default_server<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
  listen [::]:<span class="hljs-number">80</span> default_server ipv6only=on<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>

  server_name www<span class="hljs-preprocessor">.custardbelly</span><span class="hljs-preprocessor">.com</span> custardbelly<span class="hljs-preprocessor">.com</span><span class="hljs-comment">;</span>

  return <span class="hljs-number">301</span> https://www<span class="hljs-preprocessor">.custardbelly</span><span class="hljs-preprocessor">.com</span>$request_uri<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
}

server {
  listen [::]:<span class="hljs-number">443</span> ssl<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
  listen <span class="hljs-number">443</span> ssl<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>

  ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/custardbelly<span class="hljs-preprocessor">.com</span>/fullchain<span class="hljs-preprocessor">.pem</span><span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
  ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/custardbelly<span class="hljs-preprocessor">.com</span>/privkey<span class="hljs-preprocessor">.pem</span><span class="hljs-comment">;</span>

  root /var/www/custardbelly<span class="hljs-preprocessor">.com</span>/public_html<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
  index index<span class="hljs-preprocessor">.html</span> index<span class="hljs-preprocessor">.htm</span><span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
}
</code></pre><p>Essentially, I am forwarding all requests on port <strong>80</strong> to <strong>443</strong>. You will also note the entries for <code>ssl_certificate</code> and <code>ssl_certificate_key</code> which point to the cert generated using <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let&#39;s Encrypt</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is a very rudmentary example of what your site configuration should look like under nginx, but am keeping the minimum in relation to the task at hand.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I then restarted <strong>nginx</strong>:</p>
<pre><code>$ <span class="hljs-built_in">sudo</span> service nginx start
</code></pre><p>Navigating to <a href="https://www.custardbelly.com/blog">https://www.custardbelly.com/blog</a> in a browser and it showed up! Checked to make sure that the redirect under HTTP request worked as well and, sure enough, my site is now accessible under HTTPS :)</p>
<p>Now the only issue at this point is that a lot of my resources in pages point to HTTP endpoints directly... that is a sore point for a lot of browsers and results in the dreaded <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Mixed Content</strong></span>.</p>
<hr>

<h1 id="setting-up-my-site-to-be-served-under-https">Setting up my site to be served under HTTPS</h1>
<p>Once you move your site to be served up under HTTPS and then point your favorite browser to your site, you may find that it does not look or function as it did previously - as it did for me. That was because a lot of the resources on the pages of my site were being blocked because the site under HTTPS was trying to make requests for content under HTTPS; such resources were CSS files, Javascript files, images, etc.</p>
<p>If you were to open up Console panel of the developer tools in your browser when pointing to your site under HTTPS, you most likely will see a lot of <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Mixed Content</strong></span> entries. In my case, Google Chrome was blocking requests over differing protocols, even if I was making calls relative to the page (i.e., not cross-site).</p>
<p>Luckily enough, for me, I was using templates for my blog and only had to change the link references in a single template and regenerate all my posts. Once I had done that, all the pages rendered as they did previously when served under HTTP.</p>

Among the biggest changes, we left Boston for Vermont! We have begun to settle in here in the beatuiful Champlain Valley and, of course, my oldest is enrolled in hockey lessons - a sport i know very little about, but am excited to learn from him.</p>
<p>As is expected from a big move, we have found outselves in different surroundings and different living spaces. We are no longer 4 people cramped in a tiny 2-bedroom condo along the train line in Brighton, MA; we are now 4 people in a ranch house with noone above or below us to complain about taking off their loud shoes when the baby is sleeping. </p>
<p>While the extra space of a house is wonderful, tit comes with additional maintenance and care over renting an apartment. For instance, we never had a basement in our previous apartments and never had to worry about flooding or failures in a sump pump. Now we do. And we have had a handful of instances when it has occurred. While it is true that we have and will continue to have qualified people locate the source of the problem, I thought - in the meantime - it would be a fun little project to setup something that could alert me to possible water starting to accumulate in the basement.</p>
<p><img src="https://custardbelly.com/images/flood_pi_flood.jpg" alt="a flood!"></p>
<p>And from that <a href="https://github.com/bustardcelly/flood-pi">flood-pi</a> was born!</p>
<h2 id="flood-pi">flood-pi</h2>
<p><strong>flood-pi</strong> is an open source Python project meant to be run on a <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a>. The Github repo for <a href="https://github.com/bustardcelly/flood-pi">flood-pi</a> has some more technical details, but essential <strong>flood-pi</strong> detects a &quot;flood&quot; by reading an analog value from a circuit completed by water.</p>
<p>The basic premise is that two leads with copper plates at the end (originally nails in my prototype) are set level to the floor of the basement and spaced about a inch apart from each other. One lead is connected to the power while the other lead is connected to the between the first pin of the mcp3008 and the ground. As water comes between the leads (most likely from the start of a flood), the circuit is complete and a reading from 0 to 1024 is read through the ADC. Some low values may come in but should be considered not a &quot;positive&quot; detection. As well, some high values may come in which typically means that somehow the leads started touching each other and be considered not a &quot;positive&quot; detection, either. In correlation to the distance between the leads, there is a middleground of values that would be considered a &quot;positive&quot; detection.</p>
<p>When a &quot;positive&quot; detection occurs, <strong>flood-pi</strong> then sends out an email to alert me. Then I can take appropriate action.</p>
<p><em>There is no analog in on <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a>, but i have set up projects reading potentiometers using the <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/reading-a-analog-in-and-controlling-audio-volume-with-the-raspberry-pi">mcp3008 as described here on adafruit</a>, so I knew i could use that setup for this project.</em></p>
<h3 id="project">project</h3>
<p>Here&#39;s some pictures of the project:</p>
<p>The leads.</p>
<p><img src="https://custardbelly.com/images/flood_pi_leads.jpg" alt="leads"></p>
<p><a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a>, running <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/">Debian-Wheezy</a> with the <a href="https://github.com/bustardcelly/flood-pi">flood-pi</a> program running as a daemon. <a href="http://www.edimax.com/edimax/merchandise/merchandise_detail/data/edimax/global/wireless_adapters_n150/ew-7811un">Edimax WiFi adapter</a> for the interweb-bings and email-ery.</p>
<p><img src="https://custardbelly.com/images/flood_pi_rasp.jpg" alt="pi"></p>
<p>The mcp3008 on its own breakout. (<strong>i soldered it up all by myself!</strong>)</p>
<p><img src="https://custardbelly.com/images/flood_pi_mcp3008.jpg" alt="mcp3008"></p>
<h3 id="installation">installation</h3>
<p>Here&#39;s some pictures of its installation in the basement:</p>
<p><img src="https://custardbelly.com/images/flood_pi_install3.jpg" alt="full install"></p>
<p><img src="https://custardbelly.com/images/flood_pi_install1.jpg" alt="module install"></p>
<p><img src="https://custardbelly.com/images/flood_pi_install2.jpg" alt="lead install"></p>
<p>We, thankfully, haven&#39;t been able to get a <em>true</em> &quot;positive&quot; reading since its installation, but I have submersed the leads in water for a short time to ensure i was being sent emails :)</p>
<h2 id="flood-pi-admin">flood-pi-admin</h2>
<p>I couldn&#39;t just stop at getting emails. I am empoyed as a software developer by trade, so I <em>had</em> to keep writing software.</p>
<p>I wanted to aggregate the readings from <a href="https://github.com/bustardcelly/flood-pi">flood-pi</a> and get an overview of its workings (or failure of workings if it may come to that). I don&#39;t know if there could be any patterns found from the data as to when the sump pump fails or whatnot, but more data can&#39;t hurt, can it?</p>
<p>As such, <a href="https://github.com/bustardcelly/flood-pi-admin">flood-pi-admin</a> was born!</p>
<h3 id="about-flood-pi-admin">about flood-pi-admin</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/bustardcelly/flood-pi-admin">flood-pi-admin</a> is a NodeJS-based server that provides a RESTful API for POSTing and accessing daatbeing reported by <a href="https://github.com/bustardcelly/flood-pi">flood-pi</a>. There is more detailed information on the <a href="https://github.com/bustardcelly/flood-pi-admin">Github repo for the project</a>, but it has endpoints for the <strong>flood-pi</strong> detector to post confiuguration and reading data as well as two main routes for accessing information about past and current conditions. </p>
<p><strong>It&#39;s pretty bare-bones at the moment, but i plan to add new features as they are required (or requested).</strong></p>
<h3 id="charts">charts</h3>
<p>The landing page and <em>/level?range=(day|week|year|all)</em> provide chart data with the level readings:</p>
<p><img src="https://custardbelly.com/images/flood_pi_chart.png" alt="chart data"></p>
<p>The red band across the middle of the chart is the &quot;positive&quot; value range provided from the <strong>flood-pi</strong> and should be considered possible flood detection. As mentioned previously, lower values may come in but not high enough to be considered &quot;positive&quot;; additionally, high values may come in which may actually mean that the leads have somehow started touching each other rather than completing the circuit with water.</p>
<h3 id="isitflooded">isitflooded</h3>
<p>There is also a direct page at <em>/isitflooded</em> that will let you know if it is currently considered flooded or not:</p>
<p><img src="https://custardbelly.com/images/flood_pi_no.png" alt="current detection"></p>
<p>It also reports last reporting time and whether or not it should alert you to the <a href="https://github.com/bustardcelly/flood-pi">flood-pi</a> no longer reporting information.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">conclusion</h2>
<p>I had a lot of fun taking a small idea of being notified the nextr time their is water in the basement and transferring it to an actual physical devices that can send out emails upon completion of a circuit. Plus, i got better at soldering - i know the ADC breakout is a small assembly, but it made me happy the way it turned out.</p>
<p>If you have occasional water in your basement and have an interest in <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a>, i hope you check out the <a href="https://github.com/bustardcelly/flood-pi">flood-pi</a> program and install it. And if you have yourself a VPS, feel free to also setup the <a href="https://github.com/bustardcelly/flood-pi-admin">flood-pi-admin</a> on it to access level reading data.</p>
<p>Now, onto the next little pet project i have in mind:)</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>

<p>There are <a href="https://www.npmjs.org/search?q=gulp-rev">several other cache-busting plugins</a> currently available by some awesome developers and I suggest you look at those to fit your project&#39;s need.</p>
<p>For my particular project in which I decided to create the <a href="https://www.npmjs.org/package/gulp-rev-append">gulp-rev-append</a> plugin, I was looking to:</p>
<ul>
<li>enable cache-busting by appending a file hash on query string</li>
<li>not require additionally markup commenting to declare dependencies to be modified</li>
<li>not generate an additional manifest to be a dependency in file access for production-level application</li>
</ul>
<p>I was trying to develop a simple web-based mobile site on a desktop while testing on devices and cache-ing was giving me a headache. I did not want to modify my workflow and build to accommodate an addition cache-manifest, nor did I foresee my work requirng a more robust cache-busting technique that the other plugins provided. </p>
<p><em>If this project was to be in millions of hands out in production, I would certainly use a file revving solution such as <a href="https://www.npmjs.org/package/gulp-rev">https://www.npmjs.org/package/gulp-rev</a>.</em></p>
<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/bustardcelly/gulp-rev-append">gulp-rev-append</a> plugins allows for appending a query-string file hash to dependencies declared in html files defined using the following regex: <code>(?:href|src)=&quot;(.*)[\?]rev=(.*)[\&quot;]</code></p>
<p>That&#39;s fancy talk for any stylesheet or script declarations that are declared in an html file such as the following:</p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-doctype">&lt;!doctype html&gt;</span>
<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">html</span>&gt;</span>

</code></pre><p>Any subsequent runs of the <code>gulp-rev-append</code> file will change the output <em>only</em> if the target file(s) declared have been modified. This is because the revision hash is computed using the target file contents.</p>
<p>The only requirement is that the dependency to be appended with the hash be declared using <code>?rev=</code>. The <code>@@hash</code> is not required, and any value will be overriden as the dependency file contents change.</p>

<p>Using query strings to cache-bust dependencies isn&#39;t fool proof. These are some great articles that explain why:</p>

I am going to pause in actually working with <a href="https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js">CucumberJS</a> in delivering code in a BDD manner for this article and address another vital part of the development process: <strong>Automation</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="-gt-code">&gt; code</h3>
<p>Supported files related to this and any subsequent posts on this topic will be available at:<br><a href="https://github.com/bustardcelly/cucumberjs-examples">https://github.com/bustardcelly/cucumberjs-examples</a></p>
<h2 id="why-automate-">Why Automate?</h2>
<p>The benefit of automation is in time saved. If we can pinpoint tasks that we do repetitively during development and automate them, we can save large amounts of time that could be put back into doing more coding, thinking, learning, laughing, beering - the list goes on.</p>
<p>While going through the basics of <a href="https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js">CucumberJS</a> in the previous articles, I was demonstrating how I use the tool to TDD from the outside-in and constantly hopping back and forth from my code editor to the terminal to run this simple command over and over:</p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-variable">$ </span>node node_modules/.bin/cucumber-js
</code></pre><p>Now, I am pretty good at <code>CMD+TAB</code> - not to brag - but I would much prefer to get feedback on my tests instantly as I describe my asserts and modify my code. If we automate the running of <strong>Cucumber</strong> on file change, we can start seeing results quicker and we can take that time removed from manually switching between editor and terminal and running commands and put that time back into thinking how to design our code more cleanly :)</p>
<p>This automation and instant feedback really shows its worth in the <strong>Refactor</strong> phase in which you have previously implemented code to pass the criteria in a <strong>Feature</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="task-automation-and-javascript">Task Automation and JavaScript</h2>
<p>When talking about build tools and task automation for JavaScript projects, there are roughly 3 types of task runners that are brought up:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://gruntjs.com/">Grunt</a></li>
<li><a href="http://gulpjs.com/">Gulp</a></li>
<li><a href="http://substack.net/task_automation_with_npm_run">npm run</a></li>
</ol>
<p>There are additional tools that have been around for some time - particularly, in the past I have used <a href="http://ant.apache.org/">Ant</a> and <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/make/">Make</a> for my build process - but, generally speaking, these are the prevelant tools of the trade in JavaScript as it stands today. </p>
<p>Some people think that each oppose each other, but I lean toward utilizing one or the others based on its merits and the requirements of a project. I have several on-going projects, both professional and personal, and each project actually incorporates one of each of these. I will discuss my thoughts on the value of each tool within each section in which I set up automation for our <a href="https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js">Cucumber</a> tests.</p>
<h2 id="npm-run">Npm run</h2>
<p>I&#39;ll start off with the basics. By basics, I mean that there is no additonal tool required to install and get up and running with our test automation; we have everything already installed that we need: node &amp; npm.</p>
<h3 id="benifits">Benifits</h3>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/substack">James Halliday</a> had previously written a <a href="http://substack.net/task_automation_with_npm_run">great post</a> addressing the use of <code>npm run</code> in task automation, and I agree in so far as keeping things simple. The benefits of defining tasks in the <code>scripts</code> tag of your <code>package.json</code> file are <strong>a) simplicity</strong> and <strong>b) no additional tooling</strong>. I do have the reservations that the &quot;simplicity&quot; vanishes if you have to eventually maintain dozens of tasks - some that may be similar with different arguments - and continually want to run series and parallels. </p>
<p>When your build process becomes more complex, <a href="https://twitter.com/substack">James Halliday</a> does mention moving it to a bash file, but I would argue to perhaps look at a more robust solution with the tools described previously (and in more detail later in this article).</p>
<h3 id="usage">Usage</h3>
<p>If we were to simply take the process of running our tests as we have in previous articles, we can modify our <code>package.json</code> file by adding the following <code>scripts</code> tag and task:</p>
<p><em>package.json</em></p>
<pre><code>{
  <span class="hljs-string">"name"</span>: <span class="hljs-string">"cucumberjs-examples"</span>,
  <span class="hljs-keyword">...</span>
  <span class="hljs-string">"scripts"</span>: {
      <span class="hljs-string">"test"</span>: <span class="hljs-string">"node node_modules/.bin/cucumber-js"</span>
  }
  <span class="hljs-keyword">...</span>
}
</code></pre><p>Plain and simple. To run it, we&#39;d hop over to our terminal:</p>
<pre><code>$ npm run test

<span class="hljs-subst">&gt;</span> cucumberjs<span class="hljs-attribute">-examples</span>@<span class="hljs-number">0.1</span><span class="hljs-number">.0</span> test /Users/toddanderson/Documents/workspace/custardbelly/cucumberjs<span class="hljs-attribute">-example</span>
<span class="hljs-subst">&gt;</span> node node_modules<span class="hljs-subst">/</span><span class="hljs-built_in">.</span>bin/cucumber<span class="hljs-attribute">-js</span>
<span class="hljs-attribute">...</span><span class="hljs-attribute">...</span><span class="hljs-built_in">..</span>

<span class="hljs-number">2</span> scenarios (<span class="hljs-number">2</span> passed)
<span class="hljs-number">8</span> steps (<span class="hljs-number">8</span> passed)
</code></pre><p>Same result. We get to type less now, so that&#39;s good. However, we are not really automating the process for running our tests. As mentioned previously, we are looking for the benefit of automating the running of our tests on change to <strong>Step Definitions</strong> and code.</p>
<p>As such, we create a simple node script that will watch our <code>script</code> and <code>feature/step_definitions</code> and run the <a href="https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js">CucumberJS</a> CLI tool on each change:</p>
<p><strong>cuke-watcher.js</strong></p>
<pre><code>#!<span class="hljs-regexp">/usr/</span>bin/env node
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> watch = <span class="hljs-built_in">require</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'node-watch'</span>);

</code></pre><p>We are using the wonderful <a href="https://npmjs.org/package/node-watch">node-watch</a> module that is a convenient wrapper to <code>fs.watch</code>, and upon change, we spawn the <strong>Cucumber</strong> tool as a child process. Running <strong>Cucumber</strong> as a child process allows it to exit its own process without having to exit the <code>watch</code> process, which would kill all automation.</p>
<p>Modify our <code>package.json</code> to invoke this script:</p>
<p><em>package.json</em></p>
<pre><code>{
  <span class="hljs-string">"name"</span>: <span class="hljs-string">"cucumberjs-examples"</span>,
  <span class="hljs-keyword">...</span>
  <span class="hljs-string">"scripts"</span>: {
      <span class="hljs-string">"test"</span>: <span class="hljs-string">"node node_modules/.bin/cucumber-js"</span>,
      <span class="hljs-string">"watch"</span>: <span class="hljs-string">"node cuke-watcher.js"</span>
  }
  <span class="hljs-keyword">...</span>
}
</code></pre><p>And run it in the terminal:</p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-variable">$ </span>npm run watch
</code></pre><p>And you will see the cursor flash with the <code>watch</code> process running. If you were to modify any of the <strong>Step Definition</strong> or source files of our current <a href="https://github.com/bustardcelly/cucumberjs-examples">Grocery List</a> example project, you would see <a href="https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js">CucumberJS</a> run and produce the same results as before - the only difference is that it is now waiting for you to modify them again so it can run again.</p>
<p>It will continue to <code>watch</code> and run tests until you exit the process, most commonly done by focusing on the terminal and hitting <code>CTRL+C</code>.</p>
<h2 id="grunt">Grunt</h2>
<p>Up until a few years ago, I  stuck with what I knew best and preferred to maintain builds for my JavaScript projects using <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/make/">Make</a>. After having the fortunate opportunity to hear <a href="http://benalman.com/">Ben Alman</a> speak and demonstrate <a href="http://gruntjs.com/">Grunt</a> at <a href="http://2013.texasjavascript.com/">TXJS</a> in 2012, I decided to give <strong>Grunt</strong> a real try - and I have, for the most part, not looked back.</p>
<p><a href="http://gruntjs.com/">Grunt</a> is my go-to task automation tool for large projects that involve various complex tasks for developing, testing and deployment. For the most part, if my tasks are not solely based on files, I will incorporate <strong>Grunt</strong> into my project. </p>
<p>Along with a solid history and great documentation, there is also a very active community that creates task plugins for <strong>Grunt</strong>: <a href="http://gruntjs.com/plugins">http://gruntjs.com/plugins</a>. You can find virtually anything you need, and if for some odd reason you can&#39;t, you can create one: <a href="http://gruntjs.com/creating-plugins">Creating Grunt Plugins Docs</a>.</p>
<p><em>It is too much for this article to get into a discussion about <strong>Grunt</strong> and its concepts, so please read the <a href="http://gruntjs.com/getting-started">documentation</a> on their site for clarity. In this section I intend to address how to use <strong>Grunt</strong> to automate the tests we have been developing in this series.</em></p>
<h3 id="usage">Usage</h3>
<p>Just as we setup a watcher for our <strong>Step Definitions</strong> and scripts for our <code>npm run</code> example, we will be using 2 <a href="http://gruntjs.com/">Grunt</a> plugin tasks provided by the wonderful development community:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-watch">grunt-contrib-watch</a> - maintained by the contributors for gruntjs</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/s9tpepper/grunt-cucumber-js">grunt-cucumber</a> - maintained by venerable developer <a href="https://twitter.com/s9tpepper">Omar Gonzalez</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I will assume you have <a href="http://gruntjs.com/getting-started">Grunt installed properly</a> and start with the <code>Gruntfile</code>:</p>
<p><em>Gruntfile.js</em></p>
<pre><code>module.exports = <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">(grunt)</span> {</span>
<span class="hljs-pi">  'use strict'</span>;

  grunt.initConfig({
    pkg: grunt.file.readJSON(<span class="hljs-string">'package.json'</span>),
    watch: {
      cucumber: {
        files: [<span class="hljs-string">'features/**/*.js'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'script/**/*.js'</span>],
        tasks: [<span class="hljs-string">'cucumberjs'</span>]
      }
    },
    cucumberjs: {
      src: <span class="hljs-string">'features'</span>,
      options: {
        steps: <span class="hljs-string">'features/step_definitions'</span>,
        format: <span class="hljs-string">'pretty'</span>
      }
    }
  });

  grunt.loadNpmTasks(<span class="hljs-string">'grunt-contrib-watch'</span>);
  grunt.loadNpmTasks(<span class="hljs-string">'grunt-cucumber'</span>);

  grunt.registerTask(<span class="hljs-string">'watch-tests'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'Starts a watch for test automation.'</span>, [<span class="hljs-string">'watch:cucumber'</span>]);

};
</code></pre><p>Within the <code>Gruntfile</code> we have configured <code>cucumberjs</code> task with the same arguments we have been using in previous examples and configured a <code>watch</code> task to listen for changes to JavaScript files in the <em>features</em> and <em>script</em> directories.</p>
<p>Additionally, we have defined a <code>watch-tests</code> task which we can invoke using <strong>Grunt</strong> from the command line:</p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-variable">$ </span>grunt watch-tests
</code></pre><p>Running that will do, essentially, what we have done using <code>npm run</code> in the previous section: the <code>watch</code> process will be active and execute the <strong>Cucumber</strong> specs upon a change to JavaScript files in the target directories. To stop the task from running, focus on the terminal and <code>CTRL+C</code> to exit the process.</p>
<h2 id="gulp">Gulp</h2>
<p><a href="http://gulpjs.com/">Gulp</a> is a (relatively) new-comer to the JavaScript-based task runner ecosystem. Like <a href="http://gruntjs.com/">Grunt</a>, it is a task-based build tool that has <a href="https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/README.md">good documentation</a> and a lively community <a href="http://gratimax.github.io/search-gulp-plugins/">contributing plugins</a>. All good things.</p>
<p><a href="http://gulpjs.com/">Gulp</a>&#39;s build system uses <a href="http://nodejs.org/api/stream.html">streams</a> which allows you to pipe multiple tasks together. As well, the tasks defined in the <code>gulpfile</code> are the code itself - as opposed to <strong>Grunt</strong> in which you provide a configuration for your tasks that are consumed by <strong>Grunt</strong> and provided to the targetted plugin through a task registry.</p>
<p>There are <a href="http://blog.ponyfoo.com/2014/01/09/gulp-grunt-whatever">plenty</a> of <a href="http://www.100percentjs.com/just-like-grunt-gulp-browserify-now/">other articles</a> <a href="http://jaysoo.ca/2014/01/27/gruntjs-vs-gulpjs/">contrasting the two</a>, so I won&#39;t rehash them here. I will say that I choose <strong>Gulp</strong> over <strong>Grunt</strong> in projects where the build requirements are strictly focused on files - ie, take these files, do something to them (min, concat) and put them in this directory.</p>
<p><strong>As a side note: I highly recommend <a href="https://twitter.com/substack">James Halliday</a>&#39;s excellent <a href="https://github.com/substack/stream-handbook">stream-handbook</a> to get a better understanding of streams in <a href="http://nodejs.org">node</a>.</strong></p>
<h3 id="usage">Usage</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://gratimax.github.io/search-gulp-plugins/">plugin community</a> for <a href="http://gulpjs.com/">Gulp</a> is fairly active, but as I mentioned previously <strong>Gulp</strong>&#39;s system is really based on streams. As such, I don&#39;t intend to see a plugin for running <a href="https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js">CucumberJS</a> tests specifically, as we have with <a href="https://github.com/s9tpepper/grunt-cucumber-js">grunt-cucumber</a> - nor do intend to make one or continue to look for one: I don&#39;t think such a plugin is well suited to <strong>Gulp</strong>.</p>
<p>That&#39;s said, we can certainly set up a <code>watch</code> task on our <strong>Step Definitions</strong> and scripts just as we have in the previous examples!</p>
<p><strong>gulpfile.js</strong></p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> gulp = <span class="hljs-built_in">require</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'gulp'</span>);
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> watch = <span class="hljs-built_in">require</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'gulp-watch'</span>);
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> child_process = <span class="hljs-built_in">require</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'child_process'</span>);

<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> cucumber;
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> running = <span class="hljs-literal">false</span>;
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> options = [<span class="hljs-string">'node_modules/.bin/cucumber-js'</span>,
               <span class="hljs-string">'features'</span>, 
               <span class="hljs-string">'-r'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'features/step_definitions'</span>,
               <span class="hljs-string">'-f'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'pretty'</span>];

gulp.task(<span class="hljs-string">'cucumber'</span>, <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span> {</span>
  <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span>(!running) {
    running = <span class="hljs-literal">true</span>;
    cucumber = child_process.spawn(<span class="hljs-string">'node'</span>, options)
                    .on(<span class="hljs-string">'exit'</span>, <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span> {</span>
                      running = <span class="hljs-literal">false</span>;
                    });
    cucumber.stdout.on(<span class="hljs-string">'data'</span>, <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">(d)</span> {</span>
      console.log(<span class="hljs-built_in">String</span>(d));
    });

    cucumber.stderr.on(<span class="hljs-string">'data'</span>, <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">(d)</span> {</span>
      console.error(<span class="hljs-built_in">String</span>(d));
    });
  }
});

gulp.task(<span class="hljs-string">'watch-tests'</span>, <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span> {</span>
  gulp.src([<span class="hljs-string">'features/**/*.js'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'script/**/*.js'</span>])
      .pipe(watch(<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span> {</span>
        gulp.run(<span class="hljs-string">'cucumber'</span>);
      }));
});
</code></pre><p>Running that is very similar to how we ran our <strong>Grunt</strong> task:</p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-variable">$ </span>gulp watch-tests
</code></pre><p>As you may notice, this example fairly similar to the <code>npm run</code> example shown previously. The main difference is that we pipe the streams through the <code>gulp-watch</code> plugin which triggers <a href="https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js">CucumberJS</a> as a child process upon change to targetted files.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>So, which one should you use? Whichever! They each have their merits and it should be discussed with your team in alignment with the requirements for the current project.</p>
<p>It was my intent to showcase how to incoporate automated testing with <a href="https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js">CucumberJS</a> using the three most popular task runner / build tools so we can devote more time to thinking about design instead of hopping from our code editor to the terminal for each change to our <strong>Step Definitions</strong>.</p>
<p>I didn&#39;t introduce any new concepts related to <a href="https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js">CucumberJS</a>, itself, but felt it necessary to address automation at this stage within the series as I feel it is a vital part to Test-Driven Development and the Agile process and something that should be addressed in the early stages of a project.</p>
<p>That said, I look forward to the next article where we get to write more tests and which I intend to introduce running tests in a browser environment :)</p>

I walked through going from a <span style="color:red;">failing</span> feature with two scenarios to a <span style="color:green;">passing</span> cuke, while taking care to only add enough code that would make the assertions pass and refactoring as I went along under the assurance of a test harness.</p>
<p>There are a few topics that I didn&#39;t address in the previous post that I utilize in my testing process that I wanted to touch on in this post as any further articles I may write on the subject of <a href="https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js">CucumberJS</a> most likely will reference them. These are:</p>

<h2 id="world">World</h2>
<p>The <strong>World</strong> brings context to your <strong>Scenarios</strong>.</p>
<p>In the examples from <a href="https://custardbelly.com/blog/blog-posts/2014/01/08/bdd-in-js-cucumberjs/index.html">my previous post</a> variables were declared locally to the module export and available for reference within each <strong>Step</strong>. This may be suitable for some cases, but can cause issues or provide false results if you are not aware that those values last across the life cycle of <em>all</em> the <strong>Steps</strong> declared in that module. In other words, they are not reset for each <strong>Scenario</strong>.</p>
<p>To bring context to each <strong>Scenario</strong>, you can use the <strong>World</strong> constructor within which you can define various properties and methods that may be relevant in setting up the environment under test for each <strong>Scenario</strong>. Additonally, you access the defined <strong>World</strong> within each <strong>Step</strong> using the <code>this</code> keyword - just as you are familiar to in referencing context scope within JavaScript.</p>
<h3 id="example">Example</h3>
<p>If I were to take the complete steps module for the <em>Add Item</em> <strong>Feature</strong> from the <a href="https://github.com/bustardcelly/cucumberjs-examples/blob/0.1.0.post/features/step_definitions/add-item.steps.js">previous example</a> and modify it to incorporate a <strong>World</strong> context, it would look something like the following:</p>
<p>_/features/step<em>definitions/add-item.steps.js</em></p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-pi">'use strict'</span>;
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> assert = <span class="hljs-built_in">require</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'assert'</span>);

module.exports = <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span> {</span>

  <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> listItem;

  <span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>.World = <span class="hljs-built_in">require</span>(process.cwd() + <span class="hljs-string">'/features/support/world'</span>).World;

  <span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>.Given(<span class="hljs-regexp">/^I have an empty grocery list$/</span>, <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">(callback)</span> {</span>
    <span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>.myList = <span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>.createNewGroceryList();
    callback();
  });

  <span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>.When(<span class="hljs-regexp">/^I add an item to the list$/</span>, <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">(callback)</span> {</span>
    listItem = <span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>.createGroceryItem();
    <span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>.myList.add(listItem);
    callback();
  });

  <span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>.Then(<span class="hljs-regexp">/^The grocery list contains a single item$/</span>, <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">(callback)</span> {</span>
    assert.equal(<span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>.myList.getAll().length, <span class="hljs-number">1</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'Grocery List should grow by one item.'</span>);
    callback();
  });

  <span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>.Then(<span class="hljs-regexp">/^I can access that item from the grocery list$/</span>, <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">(callback)</span> {</span>
    assert.notEqual(<span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>.myList.getItemIndex(listItem), -<span class="hljs-number">1</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'Added item should be found at non-negative index.'</span>);
    callback();
  });

};
</code></pre><p>You will notice that in place of the <code>myList</code> variable declaration is a definition of the <strong>World</strong> context that will be the context for each <strong>Step</strong> in a <strong>Scenario</strong>. The <strong>World</strong> constructor is run at the start of each <strong>Scenario</strong>. As such, any properties have a life-cycle within the <strong>Steps</strong> of each <strong>Scenario</strong> that may be defined in this <strong>Feature</strong>. Again, this differs from the previous implementation where <code>myList</code> had a life-cycle through <em>all</em> the <strong>Steps</strong> of the module. </p>
<p><em>Note: The life of <code>this.myList</code> is realistically the same as the function local <code>myList</code> in the previous example, since it was being reassigned a new instance of <code>GroceryList</code> for each <strong>Scenario</strong>.</em></p>
<p>Additionally, you may notice that I have offloaded the creation or declaration of items to factory methods on the <strong>World</strong> - it&#39;s just a habit or best practice of mine and allows me to &quot;hide&quot; such implementation details within a single context so I can focus more closely on the assertion rules.</p>
<p>The <strong>World</strong> that is referenced in this <strong>Steps</strong> module is pulled in from the <em>/features/support</em> directory:</p>
<p><em>/features/support/world.js</em></p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-pi">'use strict'</span>;

<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> GroceryList = <span class="hljs-built_in">require</span>(process.cwd() + <span class="hljs-string">'/script/model/grocery-list'</span>);

<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> World = <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title">World</span><span class="hljs-params">(callback)</span> {</span>

  <span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>.myList = <span class="hljs-literal">undefined</span>;
  <span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>.createNewGroceryList = <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span> {</span>
    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> GroceryList.create();
  };
  <span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>.createGroceryItem = <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span> {</span>
    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> <span class="hljs-string">'apple'</span>;
  };

  callback();

};

module.exports.World = World;
</code></pre><p>This defines the <strong>World</strong> constructor on the <code>module.exports</code> and, when is invoked by <a href="https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js">CucumberJS</a>, is provided a <code>callback</code> delegate that you invoke when you are done &quot;prepping&quot; your <strong>World</strong> context. There are other support hooks, such as <em>BeforeEach()</em> and <em>AfterEach()</em> that are available, but I won&#39;t discuss them in this article.</p>
<p>If we were to run our tests now:</p>
<pre><code>$ node_modules<span class="hljs-subst">/</span><span class="hljs-built_in">.</span>bin/cucumber<span class="hljs-attribute">-js</span>

<span class="hljs-attribute">...</span><span class="hljs-attribute">...</span>

<span class="hljs-number">2</span> scenarios (<span class="hljs-number">2</span> passed)
<span class="hljs-number">6</span> steps (<span class="hljs-number">6</span> passed)
</code></pre><p>We arrive at the same result as before: <span style="color:green;">passing</span>.</p>
<h4 id="-gt-aside">&gt; aside</h4>
<p>This example may seem a little superfluos in its demonstration of the benefits of a <strong>World</strong> context, but - for the sake of continuity - I wanted to show how I would modify the previous example to incorporate the <strong>World</strong>. As well, we will be building off of this structure when we approach incorporating tests within a browser context.</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>The <strong>Background</strong> is part of the <a href="http://docs.behat.org/guides/1.gherkin.html">Gherkin DSL</a> that allows you to provide an overarching context for all <strong>Scenarios</strong> defined in a <strong>Feature</strong>. It is defined in your feature spec and details <strong>Steps</strong> to be run prior to each <strong>Scenario</strong> defined within the same spec. <em>It should be noted that if you use the Before Hooks the <strong>Background</strong> steps are run after those hook methods.</em></p>
<p>I use <strong>Background</strong> mainly to provide an environmental context for my <strong>Feature</strong>. With the state of JavaScript today - and sometimes wearing the full-stack developer hat - it is not uncommon that I would be writing a <a href="http://nodejs.org">node</a> module for the server-side along with browser-based modules for the client-side within the same project. Additionally, with the various module libraries and build tools available from the community today, I am sometimes developing libraries that provide a module for both the browser and <a href="http://nodejs.org">node</a>! Crazy mixed up world. But I digress...</p>
<p>The point being: <strong>Background</strong> is useful, in my testing workflow, in setting up a <strong>Feature</strong> with the context of running the Tests under <a href="http://nodejs.org">node</a> or in a browser.</p>
<p>We could modify the existing <strong>Feature</strong> created in the <a href="https://custardbelly.com/blog/blog-posts/2014/01/08/bdd-in-js-cucumberjs/index.html">previous post</a> to include a <strong>Background</strong> used in defining the environment:</p>
<p><em>/features/add-item.feature</em></p>

    When I add an <span class="hljs-property">item</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">to</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">the</span> <span class="hljs-type">list</span>

</code></pre><p>I have set up my <strong>Background</strong> to explicitly state that I have opened up the application we are building. If you have been following along, we actually had never even created a main application file - we were just testing a collection model. So this brings a little more real-life context to the situation at hand; we are in the process of building an application that people will use and interact with.</p>
<p>Within the <strong>Background</strong> you can add additional steps, such as <em>And</em>, <em>But</em>, <em>When</em> and <em>Then</em>, yet I try to stick to only having a <em>Given</em> followed by one or two <em>And</em>&#39;s or <em>But</em>&#39;s.</p>
<p>If we were to run that now:</p>
<pre><code>$ node_modules/.bin/cucumber-js

<span class="hljs-number">8</span> steps (<span class="hljs-number">2</span> <span class="hljs-literal">undefined</span>, <span class="hljs-number">6</span> skipped)

You can implement step definitions <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> <span class="hljs-literal">undefined</span> steps <span class="hljs-keyword">with</span> these snippets:

<span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>.Given(<span class="hljs-regexp">/^I have opened the grocery list application$/</span>, <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">(callback)</span> {</span>
  <span class="hljs-comment">// express the regexp above with the code you wish you had</span>
  callback.pending();
});
</code></pre><p>We&#39;d see that neither of the <em>Scenarios</em> are entered and we are alerted to an undefined step definition.</p>
<h3 id="background-step-definition">Background Step Definition</h3>
<p>I have a tendency to separate my background step definitions from my scenario step definitions - in both separate files and file naming convention. In other words, I would not add this step to the _/features/step<em>definitions/add-item.steps.js</em>. The main reason being that I reuse the same background step definitions across many features. As such, I place these steps in a separate file that is prefixed with <strong>background-</strong>:</p>
<p>_/features/step<em>definitions/background-open-application.steps.js</em></p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-pi">'use strict'</span>;
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> assert = <span class="hljs-built_in">require</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'assert'</span>);

module.exports = <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span> {</span>

    <span class="hljs-comment">// express the regexp above with the code you wish you had</span>
    callback.pending();
  });

};
</code></pre><p>Similar to how we just modified the Add Item <strong>Feature</strong>, we are defining our world and we now have a pending <strong>Step</strong> to assert as passing. Technically I save the assertions for the <em>Then</em> <strong>Steps</strong>, but when I work with <strong>Background</strong>&#39;s I consider them pretty vital to the <strong>Scenarios</strong> environment. Therefore, most of my <strong>Background</strong>&#39;s have assertions, or in the very least, asynchronous requests which invoke the callback on completion. <em>(A better example of this will be in a following post when I address testing under a browser)</em>.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s define how we expect the application to be started in the <strong>World</strong> and what sort of validation we expect to assert that, in fact, we have opened the grocery list application so that we can edit its collection:</p>
<p>_/features/step<em>definitions/background-open-application.steps.js</em></p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-pi">'use strict'</span>;

    callback();
  });

};

<p>Alright, we just added some environment context to our tests using the <strong>Background</strong> and <em>Given</em> step(s), and are bringing more solidarity to the actual testing environment in so much as we have started to address the concept that the grocery list is to be interacted with from an application. This concept was known and assumed before, yet in our previous example, we did not address an actual <strong>User Role</strong> (<em>The Shopper</em>) in context - we simply made sure that our gorcery list collection model was able to receive and retain an item.</p>
<p>That&#39;s fine, we were getting started; we had some tasks and we are not going to throw away our work.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I set out to address a few concepts associated with CucumberJS that I use regurlarly, but in doing so, I ended up modifying and refactoring the current example :) That wasn&#39;t the original intent when I started this post, but I was having fun.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>World</strong> is useful in defining context for each <strong>Scenario</strong>. I often use it to also hold factory and general operation methods that may be called across many different <strong>Scenarios</strong></li>
<li><strong>Background</strong> is useful in defining environment context across <strong>Scenarios</strong> in separate <strong>Features</strong>. I often use it to assert that the proper environment is available before stepping into the <strong>Scenarios</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think the work we went through in this post will be very beneficial when I introduce running tests under a browser. Stay tuned…</p>

In that posts series I went through thinking of User Stories for Features and Scenarios as actual development tasks, and - reading back on it - it&#39;s all very green (no pun intended) in my finding a way to deliver test-driven code. Nothing wrong with that and I will most likely look upon this and subsequent posts in the same manner. That said, I still hold true that TDD is the best way to deliver concise, tested and well thought-out code.</p>
<p>Since that time, however, I have incorporated a different tool into my <strong>TDD</strong> workflow for JavaScript-based projects that affords me the integration of Feature specs more closely to my development and truly encompasses my current ideal of <strong>Behaviour Driven Development</strong>: <a href="https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js">CucumberJS</a>. Essentially, it allows me to truly adhere to <strong>TDD</strong> while developing from the outside in - running automated tests that fail until I have written code that supports a feature.</p>
<h3 id="-gt-assumptions-and-notes">&gt; assumptions and notes</h3>
<p>For the examples in this post, it is assumed that you are familiar with <a href="http://nodejs.org">NodeJS</a>, <a href="https://npmjs.org/">npm</a>, developing node modules and common unit testing practices as these topics too large to discuss in this post.</p>

<h2 id="cucumberjs">CucumberJS</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js">CucumberJS</a> is a JavaScript port of the popular BDD tool <a href="http://cukes.info/">Cucumber</a> (which itself was a rewrite of RSpec). It allows you to define Feature Specs in a Domain-Specific-Language (DSL) - called <a href="http://docs.behat.org/guides/1.gherkin.html">Gherkin</a> - and run your specs using a command line tool which will report the passing and/or failing of scenarios and the steps they are comprised of.</p>
<p>It is important to note that <strong>Cucumber</strong> itself does not provide a default assertion library. It is a testing framework providing a command line tool that consumes defined Features and validates Scenarios by running Steps that are written in JavaScript. It is the developers choice to include the desired assertion library used in order to make those steps <span style="color:green;">pass</span> or <span style="color:red;">fail</span>. It is my intent to clarify the process by example through a single Feature with multiple Scenarios in this post.</p>

In fact, I will be re-hashing a feature spec from that series to demonstrate working through your first cuke (aka, passing feature spec).</p>
<p>If we were to remake the <a href="(https://custardbelly.com/blog/blog-pages/category/grocery-ls.html">Grocery List</a> application under TDD/BDD using <strong>Cucumber</strong>, we would first start with a feature using the <strong>Gherkin</strong> syntax:</p>
<p><em>/features/add-item.feature</em></p>
<pre><code>Feature: Shopper can <span class="hljs-built_in">add</span> <span class="hljs-operator">an</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">item</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">to</span> their Grocery List
  As <span class="hljs-operator">a</span> grocery shopper
  I want <span class="hljs-built_in">to</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">add</span> <span class="hljs-operator">an</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">item</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">to</span> my grocery list
  So that I can remember <span class="hljs-built_in">to</span> buy that <span class="hljs-keyword">item</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">at</span> <span class="hljs-operator">the</span> grocery store

  Scenario: Item added <span class="hljs-built_in">to</span> grocery list
    Given I have <span class="hljs-operator">an</span> <span class="hljs-constant">empty</span> grocery list
    When I <span class="hljs-built_in">add</span> <span class="hljs-operator">an</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">item</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">to</span> <span class="hljs-operator">the</span> list
    Then The grocery list <span class="hljs-operator">contains</span> <span class="hljs-operator">a</span> single <span class="hljs-keyword">item</span>

  Scenario: Item accessible <span class="hljs-built_in">from</span> grocery list
    Given I have <span class="hljs-operator">an</span> <span class="hljs-constant">empty</span> grocery list
    When I <span class="hljs-built_in">add</span> <span class="hljs-operator">an</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">item</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">to</span> <span class="hljs-operator">the</span> list
    Then I can access that <span class="hljs-keyword">item</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">from</span> <span class="hljs-operator">the</span> grocery list
</code></pre><p>The <strong>Feature</strong> defines a business value, while the <strong>Scenarios</strong> define the steps that provides that value. Most often, in the software development world, it is from these <strong>Scenarios</strong> that development tasks are taken on and QA tests are defined.</p>
<p>I stopped at two Scenarios, but we could very easily add more scenarios to this feature; immediately what comes to mind are item insertion rules and validation of properties that allow for an item to be added or rejected. In hindsight, it could make more sense in creating seperate feature specs for such details. We could spend a whole post on such topics, though... let&#39;s get back to the feature already defined.</p>
<p>Within each <strong>Scenario</strong> is a list of sequential <strong>Steps</strong>: <em>Given</em>, <em>When</em> and <em>Then</em>. It is these steps that <a href="https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js">CucumberJS</a> will execute after having consume this feature spec. After each of those, you can optionally have <em>And</em> and <em>But</em>, however - though necessary and unavoidable at times - I try to stay away from such additional step clauses.</p>
<h3 id="running-it">Running it</h3>
<p>Having saved that down to a file in a <strong>/features</strong> direcory, we can then run it under <strong>Cucumber</strong>:</p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-variable">$ </span>node_modules/.bin/cucumber-js
</code></pre><p>By default, <a href="https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js">CucumberJS</a> will consume all feature specs found in the relative <strong>/features</strong> directory.</p>
<p>The current console output will look something like the following which essentially means that all the steps have not been located or defined:</p>
<pre><code>UUUUUU

<span class="hljs-number">2</span> scenarios (<span class="hljs-number">2</span> <span class="hljs-literal">undefined</span>)
<span class="hljs-number">6</span> steps (<span class="hljs-number">6</span> <span class="hljs-literal">undefined</span>)

You can implement step definitions <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> <span class="hljs-literal">undefined</span> steps <span class="hljs-keyword">with</span> these snippets:

<span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>.Given(<span class="hljs-regexp">/^I have an empty grocery list$/</span>, <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">(callback)</span> {</span>
  <span class="hljs-comment">// express the regexp above with the code you wish you had</span>
  callback.pending();
});

<span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>.When(<span class="hljs-regexp">/^I add an item to the list$/</span>, <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">(callback)</span> {</span>
  <span class="hljs-comment">// express the regexp above with the code you wish you had</span>
  callback.pending();
});

<span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>.Then(<span class="hljs-regexp">/^The grocery list contains a single item$/</span>, <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">(callback)</span> {</span>
  <span class="hljs-comment">// express the regexp above with the code you wish you had</span>
  callback.pending();
});

<span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>.Then(<span class="hljs-regexp">/^I can access that item from the grocery list$/</span>, <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">(callback)</span> {</span>
  <span class="hljs-comment">// express the regexp above with the code you wish you had</span>
  callback.pending();
});
</code></pre><p>So we have 6 undefined <strong>Steps</strong> that make up 2 <strong>Scenarios</strong> and the <strong>CucumberJS</strong> ci tool even provides examples of defining them!</p>
<p>An important part of that snippet to understand is that there are only 4 steps to implement. In our <strong>Feature</strong> we have 2 <strong>Scenerios</strong> each with 3 <strong>Steps</strong>. There are a total of 6 steps, but we only need to define 4. The reason being that each <strong>Scenario</strong> shares the same <em>Given</em> and <em>When</em> step; these only need to be defined once and will be run separately for each <strong>Scenario</strong>. Essentially, if you define similar <strong>Steps</strong> using the same context, it will reuse the &quot;setup&quot; for a single <strong>Step</strong> within each <strong>Scenario</strong>.</p>
<p><em>I use &quot;setup&quot; in quotes because I mean it more in a role of defining context for <strong>When</strong> and <strong>Then</strong> steps.</em></p>
<p><em>I don&#39;t want to get it confused with the setup/teardown methods of other unit testing practices - which are known as Before/After support tasks in CucumberJS - and carry more of a context of setting up an environment in which tests are then executed (such as filling a DB of users) and then tearing down that set up.</em></p>
<h2 id="step-definitions">Step Definitions</h2>
<p>In the previous section, we saw that running <a href="https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js">CucumberJS</a> against our Add Item Feature alerted us that we have undefined (and, though not printed in <span style="color:red;">red</span>, failing) scenarios to support the feature. By default <strong>CucumberJS</strong> reads in all features from the <strong>/features</strong> directory relative to where the command was run, but it could not locate the supported step files in which these methods are defined.</p>
<p>As mentioned previously, <strong>CucumberJS</strong> does not provide an assertion library. The only assumption at this point - since the <strong>CucumberJS</strong> tool is run under <a href="http://nodejs.org/">NodeJS</a> - is that the supported steps will be loaded as node modules with an exported function to be executed. As we start implementing the steps, we will need to decide on the assertion library to use in validating our logic. We&#39;ll put that decision on the shelf at the moment and get the barebones setup to fail :)</p>
<p>To start, let&#39;s take those step definitions provided by the <strong>CucumberJS</strong> ci tool and drop them into a node module:</p>
<p>_/features/step<em>definitions/add-item.steps.js</em></p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-pi">'use strict'</span>;

module.exports = <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span> {</span>

  <span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>.Given(<span class="hljs-regexp">/^I have an empty grocery list$/</span>, <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">(callback)</span> {</span>
    callback.pending();
  });

  <span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>.When(<span class="hljs-regexp">/^I add an item to the list$/</span>, <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">(callback)</span> {</span>
    callback.pending();
  });

  <span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>.Then(<span class="hljs-regexp">/^The grocery list contains a single item$/</span>, <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">(callback)</span> {</span>
    callback.pending();
  });

  <span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>.Then(<span class="hljs-regexp">/^I can access that item from the grocery list$/</span>, <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-params">(callback)</span> {</span>
    callback.pending();
  });

};
</code></pre><p>By default, <strong>CucumberJS</strong> will look for steps to be loaded within a folder titled <code>step_definitions</code> under the <strong>/features</strong> directory relative to where you issue the command. You can optionally use the <code>-r</code> option to have <strong>CucumberJS</strong> load steps from another location. Running the default is the same as setting the following step definition directory option:</p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-built_in">.</span>/node_modules<span class="hljs-subst">/</span><span class="hljs-built_in">.</span>bin/cucumber<span class="hljs-attribute">-js</span> <span class="hljs-attribute">-r</span> features/step_definitions
</code></pre><p>The console output will now look like the following:</p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-comment">P</span><span class="hljs-literal">-</span><span class="hljs-literal">-</span><span class="hljs-comment">P</span><span class="hljs-literal">-</span><span class="hljs-literal">-</span>

</code></pre><p>Not too suprising seeing as we notify the callback of a <code>pending</code> state. <a href="https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js">CucumberJS</a> enters the first step (<em>Given</em>) and is immediately returned with a pending notification. As such, it doesn&#39;t bother with entering any subsequent steps and marks them as skipped.</p>
<p><em>Note: It is too much to get into a discussion about <a href="http://addyosmani.com/writing-modular-js/">client-side modules and AMD vs CommonJS</a>. For the purposes of this example I will be using CommonJS, as I my current interests lie in utilizing <a href="https://github.com/substack/node-browserify">Browserify</a> for client-side development. For a long time, I was a proponent of <a href="http://requirejs.org/">RequireJS</a> and AMD. Again, a whole other discussion :)</em></p>

To get closer to <span style="color:green;">green</span>, we&#39;ll tackle the <strong>Given</strong> step first:</p>

};
</code></pre><p>If we were to run that again, we&#39;d get an exception right away:</p>

<p><hr/>
In the previous section, to make the <em>Given</em> step pass on each <strong>Scenario</strong> we implemented the beginnings of a Grocery List model generated from a factory method, <code>create</code>, from the <code>grocery-list</code> module. I don&#39;t want to get into a debate of object creation, the <strong>new</strong> operator, classes and prototypes - at least not in this post - and will assume that you are familiar and comfortable (at least in reading code) with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/create">Object.create</a> defined for ECMAScript 5.</p>
<p>In reviewing the <em>When</em> step for the <strong>Scenarios</strong>:</p>
<pre><code>When I <span class="hljs-built_in">add</span> <span class="hljs-operator">an</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">item</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">to</span> <span class="hljs-operator">the</span> list
</code></pre><p>we need to provide a way in which to add an item to the Grocery List instance created in the <em>Given</em> - and do so in as little code to make the step pass...</p>
<p>First, we&#39;ll define our expectation of the make up and <code>add</code> signature of the Grocery List in the step definitions:</p>
<p>_/features/step<em>definitions/add-item.step.js</em></p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-keyword">...</span>

We progressed through our step implementations and have reached the step(s) at which we assert operations and properties that prove that our scenario provides its intended value. As mentioned previously, <a href="https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js">CucumberJS</a> does not provide an assertion library. My preference in assertion libraries is a combination of <a href="https://github.com/chaijs/chai">Chai</a>, <a href="http://github.com/cjohansen/Sinon.JS">Sinon</a> and <a href="http://github.com/domenic/sinon-chai">Sinon-Chai</a>, but for the examples in this post, I am just going to use the <code>assert</code> module that comes with <a href="http://nodejs.org">NodeJS</a>. I encourage you to check out other assertion libraries and leave a note if you have a favorite; perhaps one of these posts will address how I use <strong>Chai</strong> and <strong>Sinon</strong>.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s pause here for a second before adding more code to get this step to <span style="color:green;">pass</span>. The issue at hand is not actually adding an item to the array being returned, it is more about ensuring that an item is added through the <code>add</code> method and the result from <code>getAll</code> being a list extended with that item.</p>
<p>Implementation details that are involved in making this test pass is where your team uses their architecture experience, but care is required that only the most essential code is added and not to go overboard in thinking about the internals of the Grocery List collection model. It&#39;s a slippery tight-rope that could easily fall down a rabbit hole - just like that poorly-worded metaphor :)</p>
<h3 id="-get-back-to-work-">-- get back to work! --</h3>
<p>For the purposes of this examples, we&#39;ll use the <code>propertiesObject</code> argument of <code>Object.create</code> to define a <code>list</code> getter that will serve as a mutable array for our grocery list items:</p>

<span class="hljs-number">6</span> steps (<span class="hljs-number">1</span> pending, <span class="hljs-number">5</span> passed)
</code></pre><h3 id="second-scenario">Second Scenario</h3>
<p>In reviewing the final step of our 2nd <strong>Scenario</strong>, the pending implementation is accessing the added item:</p>
<pre><code>Then I can access <span class="hljs-keyword">that</span> <span class="hljs-property">item</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">the</span> grocery <span class="hljs-type">list</span>
</code></pre><p>To make this step pass we need to verify that we can access the item appended to the Grocery List by invoking <code>add()</code> with an item. </p>
<p>As with the implementation of accessing the length of the Grocery List, there are several ways in which we could make this test pass in the code. Again, I feel this is where software development experience and taste comes into play with regards to architecture, but I also do prefer <em>trying</em> to produce the least amount of code possible; and I will be the first to admit that sometimes I go a little absent-minded and create more code than is necessary... hence, <em>trying</em> :)</p>
<p>That said, we also have to take into account language and environment specifications in how we address making the assertion pass - and the browser, with its history, has many to consider. That is not a slight, it is just a forethought in setting expectations for requirements.</p>
<p>Specifically: suppose we were to say that the step can be verified using the <code>Array.indexOf()</code> method on the collection returned from &#39;getAll()&#39; on the Grocery List object? Without a polyfill, then we are limiting ourselves to passing assertions on <a href="http://kangax.github.io/es5-compat-table/#Array.prototype.indexOf">IE 9 and older</a>. Such considerations are just the tip of the iceberg when deciding about what to introduce into your codebase in order to have your tests pass, and really should be left up to a team discussion on what is considered necessary to get the product to production.</p>
<p>I could go on and on, but let&#39;s just assume we want to cover all bases when it comes to browsers (IE 6 and up, shudder). In my opinion, to make this second <strong>Scenario</strong> turn green, we will add a <code>getItemIndex()</code> method with the following signature:</p>
<pre><code>+ getItemIndex(itemValue):<span class="hljs-keyword">int</span>
</code></pre><p>We&#39;ll first modify the step to fail:</p>
<p>_/feature/step<em>definitions/add-item.step.js</em></p>
<pre><code>this.Then(/^I can access <span class="hljs-keyword">that</span> <span class="hljs-property">item</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">the</span> grocery <span class="hljs-type">list</span>$/, function(callback) {
  assert.notEqual(myList.getItemIndex(listItem), -<span class="hljs-number">1</span>, 'Added <span class="hljs-property">item</span> should be found <span class="hljs-keyword">at</span> non-negative index.');
  callback();
});
</code></pre><p>The acceptance in order for this test to pass is that the index at which the added item resides in the collection is non-negative. For this scenariom we are not trying to validate a specification as to <em>where</em> new item is added in a list (eg, prepended or appended), but simply that it is accessible.</p>
<p>Running that will produce an exception:</p>
<pre><code>$ ./node_modules/.bin/cucumber-js

      }
    });
  }
};
</code></pre><p>In our implementation of <code>getItemIndex</code>, the list is traversed and, if item is found, the index is returned. Otherwise, a value of -1 is returned. Essentially, how the <code>Array.indexOf</code> method works of ECMAScript 5.</p>
<p><em>Note: I know it seems silly to use Object.create from ECMAScript 5, but not Array.indexOf. The reason - mostly - being that I normally always include a polyfill for Object.create and not for Array.indexOf. I suppose habit.</em></p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In this post, I introduce how I use the BDD tool <a href="https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js">CucumberJS</a> in order to adhere to Test Driven Development in JavaScript. I went through using an example of a single <strong>Feature</strong> with two <strong>Scenarios</strong> and turning <span style="color:red;">failing</span> <strong>Steps</strong> to <span style="color:green;">green</span> cukes. If you are unfamiliar with the process with making tests fail first only to produce code to make the test pass, I hope you followed along; I may be wordy and the process could appear to take a lot of time, but development under such practices does start to move smoothly once you get in the groove. Additionally, I think there is a huge reward in having your code under a test harness when it comes to refactoring and bug fixing - both in developer health and business.</p>
<h2 id="the-future">The Future</h2>
<p>I was going to cover the following topics in this post but have decided to exclude with the hopes of re-addressing in a later post:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-tck/blob/master/world.feature">World</a> support utility</li>
<li>Build integration (<a href="http://gruntjs.com/">Grunt</a> and <a href="http://gulpjs.com/">Gulp</a>) and automation</li>
<li>Report generation for Continuous Integration</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, in a following post I want to address how I use <a href="https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js">CucumberJS</a> to run tests that rely on browser integration - ie, <strong>window</strong> and <strong>document</strong> access.</p>
<p><em>In the past I have used <a href="http://zombie.labnotes.org/">ZombieJS</a> to much success, but <a href="https://twitter.com/s9tpepper">Omar Gonzalez</a> has tipped me to him <a href="https://github.com/s9tpepper/karma-cucumberjs">Karma solution</a> that I am excited to test-drive.</em></p>

I wanted to highlight a few tools and resources I find useful in analyzing performance and delivering web pages in production with optimal load time.</p>
<h2 id="where-d-this-hat-come-from-">Where&#39;d this hat come from?</h2>
<p>Over the past decade I primarily have been a client-side application developer. Sometimes my business card changes or personal introductions are made that get &#39;engineer&#39; and &#39;architect&#39; thrown in there, but truthfully I spend my days coding applications, regardless of language. I enjoy writing and shipping code under certain practices and methodologies and ocassionally pause to assess my current workflow and modify where bottlenecks are prevelant.</p>
<p>Up until recent years I was primarily concerned with code performance; rendering pipelines and element lifecycles, user-perceived performance cases for remote or off-loaded operations, optimizing algorithms for sorting, mapping, analyzing data, etc. I still am, but I also have become increasingly focused on delivery and load perfomance - especially in today&#39;s climate of people viewing web content on handheld devices without WiFi available. </p>
<p>Perhaps it is due the increasing work of web-based clients over desktop or native applications, but - if I am being honest - I never really paid attention to load time for older web-based application projects for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Flash plugin (preload, skip intro)</li>
<li>Desktop browser targets</li>
<li>Blind naivete</li>
</ul>
<p>However, as an end-user myself (don&#39;t like the term much, either) trying to access web content on my phone while on my bus ride home, my world is consumed with <code>waiting...</code>. As such, I wised up rather quick when I started to think about how someone would be absolutely frustrated and move on after 1/4 second without seeing any visible load response from a web application I lovingly crafted to in some way (hopefully) make their life easier.</p>
<p>That&#39;s when I started incorporating page load analysis to my deployment workflow.</p>
<h2 id="best-practices">Best Practices</h2>
<p>There is excellent documentation out there regarding best practices in delivering web pages with optimal performance. Some of the best known ones are below:</p>
<p>Yahoo: <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/performance/rules.html">Best Practices for Speeding Up Your Web Site</a><br>Google: <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/best-practices/rules_intro">Web Perfomance Best Practices; Google</a><br>Steve Souders: <a href="http://stevesouders.com/hpws/rules.php">14 Rules for Faster-Loading Web Sites</a></p>
<p>I won&#39;t rehash the tidbits those articles provide, so please visit those links for a wealth of information and follow the following blogs to keep abreast of the latest in research and development of web performance:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://stevesouders.com/">Steve Souders</a></li>
<li><a href="http://calendar.perfplanet.com/">Perfomance Calendar</a>  </li>
</ul>
<p>One aspect I find interesting is that a handful of the preferred optimizations described in those articles - such as concatenation, data-uris and script and styles placement on pages - have actually become part of the build phase of my development workflow, especially with the rise of tools such as <a href="http://gruntjs.com">Grunt</a> and the developer community creating post-process tasks. </p>
<p>It is not taken for granted that I can select tools and code under certain architectural principles I perceive as providing a comfortable development environment and have these tools at my disposal to deliver the end product in an optimal fashion. <em>Another resolution for this year is to contribute more to the libraries and tools I use often - whether through code or monetary donations.</em></p>
<h2 id="manual-performance-analysis">Manual Performance Analysis</h2>
<p>There are a few sites and tools I visit that will perform analysis on a site while in development:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.webpagetest.org/">WebPageTest</a></li>
<li><a href="http://gtmetrix.com/">GTmetrix</a></li>
<li><a href="http://tools.pingdom.com/">pingdom</a></li>
<li><a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/using_chrome">PageSpeed Chrome Developer Tool</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Additonally, <a href="http://www.feedthebot.com/tools/">feedthebot</a> has a handful of neat little tools to test some things - specifically if gzip is working on your site.</p>
<p>They all - along with various other metrics - provide a scoring based on some criteria which, as far as I can tell, are defined either by <strong>Yahoo!</strong> (via <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yslow/">yslow</a>) or <strong>Google</strong> (via <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/?csw=1">PageSpeed</a>).</p>
<p>Typically I stick to opening and running <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/?csw=1">PageSpeed</a> when developing in Chrome to get a overall recommndation of optimizations and then visit <a href="http://www.webpagetest.org/">WebPageTest</a> when I want some serious analysis and am busy updating my <strong>.htaccess</strong> file with rewrites and expiries.</p>
<h2 id="integrating-performance-reporting-in-workflow">Integrating Performance Reporting in Workflow</h2>
<p>Running analysis using tools described above is a great way to see some metrics and determine what solutions to take to better the load performance of your site/application, but I like to automate all the things when I can as well as provide reporting to Continuous Integration servers so that we can document progress or failures. To provide such value, I am a strong proponent of using <a href="http://www.sitespeed.io/">sitespeed.io</a>.</p>
<p>I have nothing bad to say about <a href="http://www.sitespeed.io/">sitespeed.io</a>. It&#39;s built on top of <a href="https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs">PhantomJS</a>, <a href="https://github.com/marcelduran/yslow/">yslow</a>, <a href="https://github.com/tobli/browsertime">browsertime</a> and <a href="https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/">bootstrap</a>. You can alternatively use the <a href="http://yslow.org/phantomjs/">yslow script for PhantomJS</a> if you want something more stripped down, but <a href="http://www.sitespeed.io/">sitespeed.io</a> generates a nice set of web documents that provide performance summaries along with being able to produce a <strong><a href="http://www.sitespeed.io/documentation/#junit">JUnit</a></strong> report for CI.</p>
<p>The documentation for <strong>sitespeed.io</strong> is thorough and easy to follow along and the <a href="http://www.sitespeed.io/documentation/#configuration">configuration options</a> are insanely helpful in finding possible pages on your site that may be of issue.</p>
<h3 id="grunt-integration">Grunt integration</h3>
<p>I am sure there is some <a href="http://gruntjs.com">Grunt</a> task out there in the wild that hooks into running <strong>sitespeed.io</strong> (or I should probably just stop being lazy and make one), but I have yet to find or search for one. I personally just use <a href="https://github.com/jharding/grunt-exec">grunt-exec</a> to run the command during a build and deploy. With the proper <a href="http://www.sitespeed.io/documentation/#installation">installation of sitespeed.io</a>, I have the following subtask under <code>exec</code> task:</p>
<pre><code>grunt.initConfig({
  <span class="hljs-keyword">...</span>
  exec: {
    sitespeed: {
      cmd: <span class="hljs-string">'sitspeed.io -u http://staging.mysite.com -r ./doc/metrics'</span>
    }
  }
}
});

grunt.loadNpmTasks(<span class="hljs-string">'grunt-exec'</span>);
grunt.registerTask(<span class="hljs-string">'dryrun'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'Build, deploy and analyze.'</span>,\ 
  [<span class="hljs-string">'build'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'deploy:staging'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'exec:sitespeed'</span>]);
</code></pre><p>That generates the JUnit report and summary documentation artifacts that can be consumed and presented by your CI server of choice. I also have a tendency to use the <a href="https://github.com/marcelduran/yslow/">yslow</a> script for <a href="https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs">PhantomJS</a> in tandem on the <code>exec</code> task as that will print out my perfomance grade in the console after issuing my <strong>grunt</strong> deployment.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Sometimes, especially when working with 3rd party libraries, web fonts, etc, it is unrealistic to hit 100 for your performance grading - who am I kidding, it is damn near impossible. I try to stay above 90 and feel satisfied. </p>
<p>As well, it should be stated that the final test is actually physically visiting the sites on handheld devices over a data plan. As I mentioned previously, I usually do some perceived perfomance testing while on the bus ride home, ensuring that I don&#39;t get frustrated with the load time on my own work (and I hope I am more critical of my own stuff than others are ;)).</p>
<p>This is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to analyzing load performance and with developments coming out of Google, such as <a href="http://www.chromium.org/spdy/spdy-whitepaper">SPDY</a> and <a href="https://code.google.com/p/modpagespeed/">mod_pagespeed</a>, an exciting space to keep an eye on in order to deliver your content faster and keep end-users happily enjoying your sites and applications.</p>

<h2 id="out-with-the-old">Out with the old</h2>
<p>Within the past couple years it just felt laborious to maintain my blog - not so much in actually writing content, but rather in dealing with spam, upgrading WordPress to ward off attacks until the next upgrade, finding syntax highlight replacements and other plugins as interests changed/grew. As a consequence, I think it did affect me actually wanting to log into the admin console to write posts.</p>
<p>Along with maintenance of the my self-host WordPress being a bothersome heft, the WYSIWYG editor and all the extra bells and whistles in the admin console it provided just seemed to be a lot of useless noise. I have grown quite comfortable writing documentation in <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">markdown</a> (due, in most part, to the rise of <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>) and felt the experience of writing in such a context much more liberating and free-flowing. </p>
<p>As such, I started looking at what else was out there that would allow me to:</p>
<ul>
<li>get rid of the dynamicism of serving blog posts  </li>
<li>throw out requirement of a database to store and maintain information  </li>
<li>write posts in markdown  </li>
<li>easily generate and maintain static files</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-solution">The solution</h2>
<p>As I mentioned previously, I started investigating solutions for the line items above a few years ago. Sitting on my desire to get rid of WordPress for so long has afforded me two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>growing frustration that I still have to deal with WordPress</li>
<li>keeping track of the climate of tools that allow for generating static content from markdown</li>
</ul>
<p>Naturally, the first one I gave a shot at back in 2012 was <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, and then the <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a> framework. Truly great software which you should check out if you haven&#39;t had a chance. It was most likely the involvement of Octopress and maintenance that started to weigh down on me continuing to pursue it as an option and look for something more lightweight.</p>
<p>Within the time frame, as well, saw the rise of <a href="http://gruntjs.com/">Grunt</a>, a task-based utility built on <a href="http://nodejs.org/">nodejs</a>, and a tool I essentially use everyday in my work and personal projects. It was only natural that over the past couple years (or rather half-year) that I kept an eye out for any Grunt tasks that would generate markup from markdown; that&#39;s when <a href="https://github.com/testdouble/grunt-markdown-blog">grunt-markdown-blog</a> which utilizes the <a href="https://github.com/chjj/marked">marked</a> node module, along with <a href="https://github.com/jashkenas/underscore/">underscore</a> templating, entered my life.</p>
<h2 id="the-implementation">The implementation</h2>
<p>Though I had settled on a solution to turn markdown into markup, I had sort of started working backwards - there were more pertinent issues I had to address in order to preserve the past history of my bloggin - since 2005! (spoiler: not all <em>good</em> content).</p>
<h3 id="conversion-of-wp-posts-to-markdown">Conversion of WP posts to markdown</h3>
<p>The first thing I had to accomplish was turning all my old posts stored in a database into static content. To do just that, I found the wonderful <a href="https://github.com/mossiso/WP-Static">wpstatic</a> script. Dropping that script on my server in the same location as the <em>wp-config.php</em> file of my WordPress install - along with turning on 1000 posts per page in my WP admin console - allowed me to spit out the whole full history of posts since I started blogging by simply issuing the following:</p>
<pre><code>./wpstatic
</code></pre><p>With a full history of posts held in a single HTML file, I then used <a href="http://phantomjs.org/download.html">PhantomJS</a> to consume that file and spit out each post into a directory structure that was relative to the naming convention used for posting in WordPress.</p>
<p>I then used <a href="https://github.com/aaronsw/html2text">html2text</a> - a python module - to convert each post markup into markdown.</p>
<h3 id="conversion-of-markdown-back-to-markup">Conversion of markdown back to markup</h3>
<p>I know, I know. It seems really odd that in my first two steps I had generated valid markup and then went ahead and converted that to markdown only wanting to convert it back to markup... there is a good reason :) I wanted the markup to be consistent across previous posts and any new posts I would be writing in markdown. Using <a href="https://github.com/aaronsw/html2text">html2text</a> allowed me to conform previous HTML documents to the structure of markdown I would be using going forward.</p>
<p>With the static markdown content produced, all it takes now is running the <a href="https://github.com/testdouble/grunt-markdown-blog">grunt-markdown-blog</a> task on those files to generate static HTML documents.</p>
<p>And with that, all my previous work is preserved and available as it once was.</p>
<h2 id="the-downside">The downside</h2>
<p>The biggest benefit a database provides is being able to reference information categorically. Data stored with reference to other data stored allows for ease in generating new views and relationships. Admittedly, this is the big downside of moving my blog to static content - I do love analyzing and presenting data in new ways (its part of my job!). But, as mentioned previously, the weight of maintenance involved in the engine and tooling farly outweighed the need to move to static content than the need to access blog post data.</p>
<p>Another downside is the loss of comment association to post - and specifically the &quot;google-ability&quot; of providing a post of mine as a result of a comment being relevant to a search query. Even further, all previous comments are lost :( For that, I feel truly sorry to those of you out there who have added to the discussion on previous posts; I apologize for throwing them out with the bath water. If the previous comments corrected some information with the post or provided valuable insight, I did make it a habit of ammending the post and those should still be part of the static replacement. If you see something that is out of place or would like to be added, please get in touch.</p>
<h2 id="the-brightside">The brightside</h2>
<p>I am free of WordPress :)</p>
<p>I do want to state that WordPress is not bad or evil - far from it. It had just become a burden for me; I much prefer just writing thoughts out in markdown and then issuing a command to generate and deploy new, static content.</p>

</code></pre><h2 id="what-">What?</h2>
<p><img src="https://custardbelly.com/images/caddis.jpg" alt="Caddis Fly Lure"><br>A caddis is a moth-like insect often used as models for fly lures in fishing.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/bustardcelly/caddis">caddis</a> CLI tool is used to start and stop a RESTful JSON service with the ability to POST route configuration and responses, on-the-fly, for mocking and testing purposes.</p>
<p><em>It may be a stretch, but there&#39;s wit in there somewhere...</em></p>
<h2 id="why-">Why?</h2>
<p>There are other projects I have been a part of, such as <a href="https://github.com/infrared5/madmin">madmin</a>, that allow for dynamically creating RESTful APIs through a User Interface and allows for persistance through I/O.</p>
<p>Recently, I was involved with mocking a service layer for unit testing purposes and found that the manual curation of such an API was too tedious for the task at hand - I wanted the process to be much more fluid and simple.</p>
<p>In this particular instance I needed to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Start a server in setup/before</li>
<li>Dynamically add a route to the service with mock JSON response</li>
<li>Run the test</li>
<li>Shut down the server in teardown/after</li>
</ol>
<p>Fairly simple, and most of all I didnt want any artifacts lying around - in other words I didn&#39;t need for any routes that I dynamically created to stick around on my local disk after the tests were done.</p>
<p>As such, <a href="https://github.com/bustardcelly/caddis">caddis</a> was born.</p>
<h2 id="how">How</h2>
<p>As mentioned briefly above, <a href="https://github.com/bustardcelly/caddis">caddis</a> is a CLI tool. It is recommended to install globally:</p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-variable">$ </span>npm install -g caddis
</code></pre><p><em>&gt; you may need to <code>sudo</code></em></p>
<p>Once installed, you can start the service (currently defaults to <a href="http://localhost:3001">http://localhost:3001</a>) and begin POSTing route configurations in JSON. Here is an example using cUrl that dynamically adds a GET route at <code>/foo</code> with a simple JSON payload of <code>{&quot;bar&quot;:&quot;baz&quot;}</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ curl -X POST -d <span class="hljs-string">'{"</span>method<span class="hljs-string">":"</span>GET<span class="hljs-string">", "</span>uri<span class="hljs-string">":"</span>/foo<span class="hljs-string">", "</span>response<span class="hljs-string">":{"</span>bar<span class="hljs-string">":"</span>baz<span class="hljs-string">"}}'</span> http:<span class="hljs-comment">//localhost:3001/api --header "Content-Type:application/json"</span>
</code></pre><p>You are not confiuned to cUrl - you can use whatever networking library in whatever language you are writing your tests in and the server can handle all modern RESTful methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>GET</li>
<li>POST</li>
<li>PUT</li>
<li>DELETE</li>
</ul>
<p>When you are finished, simply stop the <a href="https://github.com/bustardcelly/caddis">caddis</a> server:</p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-variable">$ </span>caddis stop
</code></pre><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

In this post I intend to address how to use the format reporting options of the <strong>cucumberjs-browser</strong> tool to enable integration with the <a href="https://ci.testling.com/">testling</a> automated cross-browser testing tool to run your specs in various browser environment targets that you may not have installed on your own system.</p>
<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
<p>For the purposes of this article, it is assumed that you are knowledgable of <a href="http://nodejs.org">node</a> and <a href="http://npmjs.org">npm</a> and familiar with creating feature specs for <a href="https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js">CucumberJS</a>. </p>
<p>To view examples of features and step definitions for a browser-based application, please visit the <a href="https://github.com/bustardcelly/cucumberjs-examples">cucumberjs-examples</a> repo, from which this post will use to demonstrate integrating the generated testrunner from <a href="https://github.com/bustardcelly/cucumberjs-browser">cucumberjs-browser</a> with <a href="https://ci.testling.com/">testling</a>.</p>
<h2 id="cucumberjs-browser">cucumberjs-browser</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/bustardcelly/cucumberjs-browser">cucumberjs-browser</a> CLI tool provides the ability to run your feature specs in the browser by bundling your features, steps and support files - written in the usual way you would - to be run and evaluated at runtime by the browser-based <a href="https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js">CucumberJS</a> testrunner</p>
<p>To install <strong>cucumberjs-browser</strong>:</p>
<pre><code>$ npm install <span class="hljs-attribute">-g</span> cucumberjs<span class="hljs-attribute">-browser</span>
</code></pre><p><em>you may need to <code>sudo</code></em></p>
<p>After installation, the <a href="https://github.com/bustardcelly/cucumberjs-browser">cucumberjs-browser</a> will be accessible on the command-line using <code>cucumberjs-browser</code> and can be run within any directory that has <strong>Features</strong> and <strong>Step Definitions</strong> (along with optional support files) that can be consumed by <a href="https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js">CucumberJS</a>.</p>
<p>The <strong>cucumberjs-browser</strong> CLI tool can be run with the following options:</p>
<pre><code>$ <span class="hljs-tag">cucumberjs-browser</span> <span class="hljs-attr_selector">[-o outdir]</span> <span class="hljs-attr_selector">[-f format]</span> <span class="hljs-attr_selector">[--tmpl template]</span> <span class="hljs-attr_selector">[--features features]</span>
</code></pre><p>Though it is strongly encouraged to provide a custom template using the <code>--tmpl</code> option, for the purpose of this article, we will focus on the format (<code>-f</code>) option. As of the writing of this article, the following format options are available:</p>
<ul>
<li>ui</li>
<li>tap</li>
<li>testem</li>
<li>saucelabs</li>
</ul>
<p>For the purpose of this article, we will be discussing the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_Anything_Protocol">TAP</a> format option value.</p>
<p><em>For more infromation about other format options, please visit the latest <a href="https://github.com/bustardcelly/cucumberjs-browser/wiki/Formats">documentation regarding formats</a> on the <a href="https://github.com/bustardcelly/cucumberjs-browser">cucumberjs-browser</a>.</em></p>
<h2 id="tap">TAP</h2>
<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_Anything_Protocol">Test Anything Protocol</a> is a specification for reporting test information. The benefit of using such a specification is that it can be consumed by any test harness that recognizes it.</p>
<p>You can output <strong>TAP</strong> reports from <a href="https://github.com/bustardcelly/cucumberjs-browser">cucumberjs-browser</a> using the <code>tap</code> value for the foromat option:</p>
<pre><code>$ cucumberjs<span class="hljs-attribute">-browser</span> <span class="hljs-attribute">-f</span> tap
</code></pre><p>Running this command will generate the necessary files to print <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_Anything_Protocol">TAP</a> test results in the console when loaded by a browser.</p>
<p>If you were to open the generated testrunner file in a browser using the example from <a href="https://github.com/bustardcelly/cucumberjs-examples">cucumberjs-examples</a>, you would see something like the following if you were to open the browser console:</p>
<pre><code>TAP <span class="hljs-property">version</span> <span class="hljs-number">13</span>

</code></pre><p>It should be noted that the <code>tap</code> listener for <a href="https://github.com/bustardcelly/cucumberjs-browser">cucumberjs-browser</a> uses the excellent <a href="https://github.com/substack/tape">tape</a> module.</p>
<h2 id="testling">testling</h2>
<p>I can&#39;t say enough how much I appreciate <a href="https://ci.testling.com/">testling</a>. You can install <strong>testling</strong> locally to run tests on the browsers installed on your system or use their remote service to run tests against various browsers that may not be available to you, yet are required as targets for your current project.</p>
<h3 id="local">local</h3>
<p>You can install <a href="https://ci.testling.com/">testling</a> to be run locally:</p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-variable">$ </span>npm install -g testling
</code></pre><p>To run it, change directories into the generated files from <a href="https://github.com/bustardcelly/cucumberjs-browser">cucumberjs-browser</a> and run the following command:</p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-variable">$ </span>cd browser-test
<span class="hljs-variable">$ </span>testling
</code></pre><p>That will consume a local <code>package.json</code> file and read a <code>testling</code> entry with options associated with running the generated html file againsta installed browsers on your system:</p>
<p><em>/browser-test/package.json</em></p>
<pre><code>{
<span class="hljs-keyword">...</span>

  <span class="hljs-string">"testling"</span> : {
    <span class="hljs-string">"html"</span> : <span class="hljs-string">"cucumber-testrunner.html"</span>,
    <span class="hljs-string">"browsers"</span> : [
        <span class="hljs-string">"chrome/latest"</span>,
        <span class="hljs-string">"firefox/latest"</span>,
        <span class="hljs-string">"safari/latest"</span>
    ]
  },

<span class="hljs-keyword">...</span>
}
<span class="hljs-keyword">...</span>
</code></pre><p>Truthfully, I never run <a href="https://ci.testling.com/">testling</a> locally. The main reasons being </p>
<p><strong>a)</strong> I can automate the running of specs on locally installed browsers easier with other tools (this is for another post :) )<br><strong>b)</strong> Testling provides a bigger benefit in providing tests against browsers I would otherwise have to install VMs for.</p>
<p>That said, I don&#39;t want ot pursuade you from using <strong>testling</strong> locally if it provides benefit in your workflow.</p>
<h3 id="remote">remote</h3>
<p>To use the remote service that <a href="https://ci.testling.com/">testling</a> provides, you still define the <code>testling</code> property in your <code>package.json</code> for the project as described above, but you additionally have to provide a webhook for your <strong>git</strong> repo in order to invoke the test harness. Upon a <code>PUSH</code> to your repository, <a href="https://ci.testling.com/">testling</a> will run the specified HTML file under the listed target browsers and report results based on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_Anything_Protocol">Test Anything Protocol</a> output printed to <code>console</code>.</p>
<p>In addition to providing a great service, you also get the option of adding a nice looking badge to your project.</p>
<p><img src="https://custardbelly.com/blog/images/testling-1.png" alt="testling harness output"></p>
<p>This badge was produced by pushing an update to the <a href="https://github.com/bustardcelly/cucumberjs-examples">cucumberjs-examples</a> exampe repo with a defined webhook. (If you followed along in the previous articles, you will note that the failing IE tests are due to the use of <code>Object.create</code> in source without a polyfill).</p>
<p>_The process of adding a webhook to your project is described in better detail in the <a href="https://ci.testling.com/guide/quick_start">testling documentation</a>._</p>
<h3 id="donate">donate</h3>
<p>If you do use <a href="https://ci.testling.com/">testling</a> in any fashion, I implore you to <a href="https://ci.testling.com/donate">donate to the cause</a> :)</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In this article I introduced how the <a href="https://github.com/bustardcelly/cucumberjs-browser">cucumberjs-browser</a> CLI tool can be used to generate a browser-based testrunner to report tests in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_Anything_Protocol">TAP</a> format and integrate the invaluable <a href="https://ci.testling.com/">testling</a> service to run the tests on various browsers that may not be at your disposal otherwise.</p>
<p>While <a href="https://ci.testling.com/">testling</a> provides one consumer endpoint, using the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_Anything_Protocol">TAP</a> specification in reporting test results can easily be consumed by another test harness of your choice.</p>
