# [BitmapData sunday](http://custardbelly.com/blog/2005/09/18/bitmapdata-sunday/)

[click me](javascript:MM_openBrWindow('insets/index.html','bitmaptrial','resizable=no,width=220,height=120');)

i implemented the walk-cycle into my experiment blogged about yesterday – also threw in a little dropShadowFilter just for fun:)  
i don’t know how i feel about it performance wise just yet. Looks to perform alright, but BitmapData.copyPixel every nth frame might take a pretty good hit… especially when i throw some enemies in there…
