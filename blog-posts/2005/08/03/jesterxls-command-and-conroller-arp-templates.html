		<p><a href="http://www.jessewarden.com/archives/2005/08/arp_labs_upload.html">JesterXL has posted about his modification</a> to the <a href="http://osflash.org/doku.php?id=arp">ARP framework</a> involving the CommandTemplate and the ControllerTemplate allowing arguments to be passed using a runCommand function instead of the dispatchEvent, and i couldn’t be happier.<br>
I use the ARP framework at work and have often wanted to pass arguments along to commands, mainly because i would want to run the same command from different instances but sometimes alert the user of success or fail and other times not- don’t ask me why- but, also so i didn’t have to keep creating public vars and functions in the main class to grab something i didn’t think needed to be held by it.<br>
I had started trying to work on putting this together, but work got back up and projects needed to be escorted out the door… so… thanks Jesse!</p>
