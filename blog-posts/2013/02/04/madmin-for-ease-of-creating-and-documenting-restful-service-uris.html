	<div class="entry-content full-content">
		<p>My company, <a href="http://infrared5.com" target="_blank">Infrared5</a>, recently released an Open Source project called <a href="https://github.com/infrared5/madmin">madmin</a>, which I had the great pleasure of being a main part of. </p>
<p><strong>madmin</strong> is a node-based application that allows for generating immediately accessible RESTful URIs. Though it is possible to communicate with command line tools like cURL,  <strong>madmin</strong> also provides a client-side console to easily create the URIs and structure of JSON response(s). It was originally intended to solve a front-end development problem in maintaining two sets of code – a <em>fake</em> service layer and <em>production-level</em> service layer – during development, but has grown to be a proven way to facilitate communication between the server-side and client-side teams in discussing the requirements of the services for a project. It also proved to be pretty handy documentation, to boot, which could be easily discussed with clients.</p>
<p>Anyway, you can read a more detailed description of the project and how it came to fruition over at the <a href="http://blog.infrared5.com" target="_blank">Infrared5 blog</a>: <a href="http://blog.infrared5.com/2013/01/introducing-madmin-an-admin-console-for-generating-mock-services-with-restful-uris/">http://blog.infrared5.com/2013/01/introducing-madmin-an-admin-console-for-generating-mock-services-with-restful-uris/</a></p>
<p>If you check it out, I hope you find it useful in any way and please log issues for requests or fork it to add features! I intend to get more basic instructions up on the wiki at its <a href="https://github.com/infrared5/madmin">github location</a> and perhaps write a few blog posts as well.</p>
