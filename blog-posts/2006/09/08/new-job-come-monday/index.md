[Schematic](http://schematic.com/) has opened a new office in Boston, and i am happy to announce that i have accepted a position there and looking forward to working alongside some extremely talented people.  
Just finishing up some documentation on the numerous projects and products i have worked on as an xplanaPloyee, and am anxious to get my hands dirty with a different and exciting company and get back to some personal projects iâ€™ve put on hold ( cause of a [wonderfully busy month](http://custardbelly.com/blog/?p=54) ).

Also celebrating a birthday Monday- so if anyone out there is going to the [Radio Birdman](http://www.myspace.com/theofficialradiobirdman) show on Saturday, buy me a beer.
