thank you [Sleater-Kinney](http://www.sleater-kinney.com/index2.php). thank you [Dead Meadow](http://www.deadmeadow.com/).  
officially the loudest concert i have been to- but the temporary hearing loss has afforded me the pleasure of muffling any trivial outside noise so i can clearly hear my head replaying all the songs.
