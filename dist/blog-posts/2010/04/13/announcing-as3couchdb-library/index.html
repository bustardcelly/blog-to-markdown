    <p><em>The library is available on github at <a href="http://github.com/bustardcelly/as3couchdb">bustardcelly/as3couchdb</a>. You can read more detailed information on <a href="http://wiki.github.com/bustardcelly/as3couchdb/">the wiki</a>. Continue reading to hear me blab on and on.</em></p>
<p>When the new year came and i had finally got in <a href="http://custardbelly.com/blog/?p=132">my last chapter</a> for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Flex-Cookbook-Real-world-developing-Applications/dp/0596805616/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1271029122&amp;sr=8-1">Flex 4 Cookbook</a>, it was time to return to my list of things to learn. I started looking into <strong>Capuccino</strong> and <strong>Closure</strong> and bought a book on <strong>Python</strong>. Somewhere along the way i just clicked on some tweet about 5 emerging trends that <em>i must know about</em>. Usually i find these lists are a grain-of-salt bandwagon of buzzery – maybe some truth but can’t cut through the true meaning of why this person is writing about them. But one did stick – <strong>NoSQL</strong>. I looked into the different implementations and right away i took a fancy to <strong><a href="http://couchdb.apache.org/">CouchDB</a></strong>. I don’t know why. It seemed quite simple. Working with a database using <strong>REST</strong> calls. Sounds good. And i could write my own map-reduce views in Javascript. Sign me up.</p>
<p>What also was a big draw to me was the concept of document revisions in <strong>CouchDB</strong>. I had worked on a couple projects that required <strong>online/offline synchronization</strong> and it was quite a pain to keep track of last modified entries and cleanup of deleted entries in a SQL database. The revisioning system for documents (entries) is built into <strong>CouchDB</strong> and what is more is that you are not locked into a rigid data structure and ensure your table relations are scalable. That’s not to say that building relational databases isn’t a fine art. It is. And there are many smarter people than me that get paid more money that have that craft. I don’t. The concept of revisions is familiar to me and i am greatly intrigued by the concept of <strong>NoSQL</strong>.</p>
<p>Anyway, i started digging into <strong><a href="http://couchdb.apache.org/">CouchDB</a></strong> and figured the one way for me to see the whole picture was to hook up a client side end to make these requests. See if what i was reading about was something i could use as a different approach to <strong>online/offline synchronization</strong> in my applications. What came out was a whole library for working with databases and documents of a <strong>CouchDB</strong> instance – a library which is now available on <strong>github</strong> at <a href="http://github.com/bustardcelly/as3couchdb">http://github.com/bustardcelly/as3couchdb</a>.</p>
<p>Took me long enough to get talking about the <strong>as3couchdb</strong> library mentioned in the title, didn’t it? Well, you can read more long-winded explanations about the make-up of the library from <a href="http://wiki.github.com/bustardcelly/as3couchdb/">the wiki on github</a>, and browse <a href="http://github.com/bustardcelly/as3couchdb/tree/master/examples/flex/">some examples that use the library</a> (currently all Flex examples, but AS3 examples are coming soon).</p>
<p>If you are still around, i can give a brief synopsis of the project:</p>
<p>When i set out on creating the <a href="http://github.com/bustardcelly/as3couchdb">as3couchdb</a> library, i knew i wanted to follow a similar approach to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_access_object"><strong>Data Access Objects</strong></a>. I wanted to make all my requests through the object i was working with and have an intermediate layer that communicate with the service and updated the object accordingly. To achieve this, i went about creating a <em>base model</em> class that contains a <em>model entity</em>. The <em>model entity</em> is really only involved in parsing custom metadata and resolving the information to properties held on the <em>base model</em>. Extending the <em>base model</em> are the two core models of <strong>CouchDB</strong> that you interact with: the <em>Database</em> and the <em>Document</em>.</p>
<p>So the <em>Database</em> and <em>Document</em> models can be though of as the <strong>Business Objects</strong> and expose methods that related to <strong>CRUD</strong> operations. <em>Even though <strong><a href="http://couchdb.apache.org/">CouchDB</a></strong> has a <strong>REST</strong> API, i chose using simple <strong>CRUD</strong> method signitures on the models as they seem easier to read and understand.</em> From these methods, the models interact with a <em>service mediator</em> (similar to <strong>Data Access Object</strong>), which knows how to communicate with the service proxy and has <em>action handlers</em> that know how to modify the model once a successful result is received. To put it in code terms:</p>
<p><em>I wanted to have the ease of creating and storing a document as such</em></p>
<p><code>var contact:ContactDocument = new ContactDocument();  
contact.firstName = &quot;Todd&quot;;  
contact.lastName = &quot;Anderson&quot;;  
contact.addEventListener(CouchActionType.CREATE, handleContactCreate);  
contact.create();</code></p>
<p><em>And the ease to simply read in for modification as such:</em></p>
<p><code>var contact:ContactDocument = new ContactDocument();  
contact.addEventListener(CoachActionType.READ, handleContactRead);  
contact.read( $uid );</code></p>
<p>In order to make this all work and auto-wire the models with a <em>service mediator</em>, custom annotations were needed. This is where the <em>model entity</em> mentioned earlier comes into play. When extending the core models (as <strong>ContactDocument</strong> does in the previous examples) you add custom metadata that relates to the <strong>CouchDB</strong> instance you intend to work with and the fully qualified classnames of the target <em>service mediator</em> and <em>request object</em>.</p>
<p>Now the <em>request object</em> is a different story and was brought into the picture due to the lack of HTTP method types available for the web version of <strong>Flash Player</strong>. As such, there are a couple different <em>request object</em> types available in <strong>as3couchdb</strong>: straight-up devil-may-care requests using <strong>URLRequest</strong> (mainly for <strong>AIR</strong> or you will get RTEs), one that uses <strong>External Interface</strong>, and one that uses <a href="http://github.com/gabriel/as3httpclient">as3httpclientlib</a>. The <a href="http://github.com/gabriel/as3httpclient">as3httpclientlib</a> allows you to make PUT and DELETE requests using a <strong>Socket</strong> and is the best way to interact with a <strong>RESTful</strong> service when limited to the Flash web player (imho).</p>
<p>So that is a brief rundown of the model and business layer implementation i strove for when creating <strong>as3couchdb</strong>. As i mentioned way back in upward-page-scroll land, the original drive to make <strong>as3couchdb</strong> was to see if i could ease up the pain of developing an application that uses <strong>online/offline synchronization</strong>. That is in the works and maybe this blog will become a little more active as I dive into that task.</p>
<p>If you made it this far, thank you for reading all this. Wow. You are a trooper. Tell your boss i said it is okay and you can bill that time.</p>
