		<p>I just made an initial commit to <a href="http://github.com/bustardcelly/" target="_blank">github</a> with an <a href="http://github.com/bustardcelly/as3flobile" target="_blank"><strong>as3flobile</strong> library</a> extension named <a href="http://github.com/bustardcelly/as3flobile-android" target="_blank"><strong>as3flobile-android</strong></a>. </p>
<p><a href="http://github.com/bustardcelly/as3flobile-android" target="_blank"><img src="http://custardbelly.com/blog/images/as3flobile_android.png" alt="as3flobile-android"></a></p>
<p>The intent of <strong>as3flobile-android</strong> is to provide custom skins and controls that target the look-and-feel of the <strong>Android</strong> platform. Currently within the library are graphic assets, custom skins and a few *convenience* controls which are composite controls that extend their <strong>as3flobile</strong> counterpart with the skinning already wired up (take for instance the <strong>AndroidScrollList</strong> which extends <strong>ScrollList</strong> to provide custom item renderers and skins that have the look-and-feel of the Android list – also has the precense of scrollbars on scroll behaviour!).</p>
<p>Now, it should be said, i didn’t go all out and study/push every pixel to make the skins look *exactly* like <strong>Android</strong>. I just cut some graphics from a PSD and applied them in the skins. This is a project (of many) that i do on my spare time and if/when i do need to have themed rolled in for a paying client, i am sure a designer wold be breathing down my neck <img src="http://custardbelly.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley">  That said, If at the very least, it will provide an example  to anyone who is interested applying custom skins to <strong>as3flobile</strong> components. </p>
<p>It should be noted (as it also is in the <strong>README</strong> markdown for the<strong> as3flobile-android</strong> repository) that I cut the graphics from a PSD made available by <strong>Pavel Macek</strong>. That PSD can be found at <a href="http://www.matcheck.cz/androidguipsd/" target="_blank">http://www.matcheck.cz/androidguipsd/</a> so check it out. The library also includes the <strong>ScaleBitmap</strong> from <a href="http://www.bytearray.org">bytearray.org</a>, available at <a href="http://www.bytearray.org/?p=118" target="_blank">http://www.bytearray.org/?p=118</a> and is pretty awesome. I made a slight modification to the source in order to re-use graphics in the skins (details can be found in the <strong>CHANGES</strong> document) so i could not have it external and compiles against.</p>
<p>There are a few more custom controls targeting the Android platform that i have yet to check in as i would like to drum up some examples before then. These include things like a <strong>ContextMenu</strong>, <strong>AlertDialog</strong>, <strong>TitleBar</strong>, etc. And most likely the <strong>Menu</strong> control from as3flobile will be moved to <strong><a href="http://github.com/bustardcelly/as3flobile-android" target="_blank">as3flobile-android</a></strong> as it really is Android specific… so look out for that.</p>
<p>Criticism and feedback is always welcome.</p>
