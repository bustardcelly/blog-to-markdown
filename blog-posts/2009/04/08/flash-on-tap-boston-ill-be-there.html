<p>Aah. When springtime in Boston hits, the weather is still cold for a couple months and the beer is flowing again. Actually, the beer flows all the time and the weather is unpredictable. Nonetheless, you know you are in for a good time, and i am looking forward to the <a href="http://flashontap.com/fot/index.html">Flash On Tap</a> debut in my home town.</p>
<p>The beer sponsor list is amazing. Most beers you won’t be able to find on tap in our fair city, let alone the lot of them all in one place – aside from *possibly* my <a href="http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/2247/?view=beerfly" target="_blank">neighborhood</a> haunts in <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=brookline+ma&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;split=0&amp;gl=us&amp;ei=Vj_dSZPfHePulQfx46D0DQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=geocode_result&amp;ct=title&amp;resnum=1" target="_blank">Brookline</a> (hit em up when you are out here). Stone, Smuttynose, Haverhill, Boulder.. the list goes on. In that order for me at least. I am excited about Haverhill, because even though it is a local brew (you gotta try, their LeatherLips it is awesome) some i have not tried because they are just not out here in my brick-filled neck of the woods. </p>
<p>Oh yeah… And then there’s gonna be some people rambling on about what-nots and crap. If you ain’t pourin’, i’m snorin’. That’s what i say. In all seriousness, <a href="http://flashontap.com/fot/index.html#/speakers/">the line up is insane</a>. The beer is just icing on a knowledge cake waiting to cook.</p>
<p>See my sad face and full belly as i drink all the Ruination.</p>
