	<div class="entry-content full-content">
		<p>i had a life story written of how i started out trying to make games in flash, but i was getting blah blah, so – in short – much credit to<a href="http://www.tonypa.pri.ee/tbw/index.html"> tonypa</a>, <a href="http://oos.moxiecode.com/">out of society</a> and <a href="http://bit-101.com">Keith Peters</a> for getting my feet wet. online there was very little resources for creating games based on OOP (though <a href="http://video-animation.com/mx2k_00.shtml">steve</a> has some excellent tutorials) so i tried to marry my practices used at work with that of what was available on the internet *mostly in AS1.<br>
plus my mind wonders pretty frequently, so to follow a whole tutorial is hard. i tend to get through about 1/5 of it, stop looking at it, (maybe throw on <a href="http://www.cheaptrick.com/ctalbum3.html">Heaven Tonight</a> or <a href="http://www.deadmoonusa.com/dm_mtr390.htm">Trash&amp;Burn</a>), and start trying to incorporate what i learned with what i already know, and get frustrated that nothing is working the way i want (blah blah).<br>
while i was making another game, i started to realize i had gotten “smarter” (all thanks to Keith, <a href="http://blog.pixelconsumption.com">Sam</a> and <a href="http://colbygrenier.com">Colby</a>) and thought i throw something up here for anybody that is in the same boat i am – trying to make sense of making games in Flash using OOP principles instead of the timeline and symbol-based functions.</p>
<p>First up: the basic Hero. i only call it the Hero because it reacts to user controls like the keyboard, though i could be proven wrong. </p>
<p>download it <a href="http://custardbelly.com/downloads/hero_trial.zip">here</a> and have a look around.<br>
if any of you have a different approach or any questions, leave a comment. i am terrible at commenting my code so…<br>
and here is a short list of people and sites you should really check out:</p>
